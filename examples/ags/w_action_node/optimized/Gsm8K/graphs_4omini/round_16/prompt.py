ENHANCE_SOLUTION = """Given the problem and its solution, your task is to enhance the solution by:
1. Checking for any mathematical errors or inconsistencies
2. Ensuring all steps are clearly explained
3. Adding any missing intermediate steps
4. Providing a brief explanation of the key concepts used in the solution

Please provide the enhanced solution in a clear, step-by-step format."""

If they are mostly similar with only minor changes, respond with "similar". If they are significantly different with major improvements or changes in approach, respond with "different"."""

CREATIVE_SOLUTION = """Given the problem and a previous solution, your task is to generate a new, creative solution using a different approach or methodology. Consider alternative mathematical techniques, unconventional problem-solving strategies, or innovative ways to conceptualize the problem. Ensure that your solution is:

1. Mathematically correct
2. Clearly explained with step-by-step reasoning
3. Significantly different from the previous solution
4. Potentially more elegant, efficient, or insightful
