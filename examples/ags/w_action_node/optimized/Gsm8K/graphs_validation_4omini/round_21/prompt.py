ENHANCE_SOLUTION = """Given the problem and its solution, your task is to enhance the solution by:
1. Checking for any mathematical errors or inconsistencies
2. Ensuring all steps are clearly explained
3. Adding any missing intermediate steps
4. Providing a brief explanation of the key concepts used in the solution

Please provide the enhanced solution in a clear, step-by-step format."""

ALTERNATIVE_APPROACH = """Given the problem and identified heuristics, generate a solution using an alternative approach or method that differs from the most common or straightforward solution. Consider using different mathematical techniques, formulas, or problem-solving strategies. Provide a clear, step-by-step explanation of your alternative solution."""

CREATIVE_SOLUTION = """Given the problem and identified heuristics, generate a creative and innovative solution that approaches the problem from an unconventional angle. Think outside the box and consider unique perspectives or problem-solving techniques that may not be immediately obvious. Provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation of your creative solution."""

IDENTIFY_HEURISTICS = """Analyze the given problem and identify any problem-specific heuristics or common solution patterns that could be applied. Consider the following:
1. The type of mathematical problem (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus)
2. Key words or phrases that suggest specific techniques or formulas
3. Common solution strategies for similar problems
4. Any simplifying assumptions that could be made

Provide a concise list of identified heuristics or solution patterns that could guide the problem-solving process."""
