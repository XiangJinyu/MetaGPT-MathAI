Find the smallest positive integer that is greater than $1$ and relatively prime to the product of the first 20 positive integers.  Reminder: two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor is 1.,23,"Two numbers are relatively prime if they share no prime factors.  Therefore, the desired positive integer must not share any prime factors with the product of the first 20 positive integers.  So, every prime in the prime factorization of the desired positive integer is greater than 20, which means the smallest possible integer is $\boxed{23}$.",1,0.0039571499999999996

Both right triangles are 30-60-90 triangles. Therefore, the length of the shorter leg in each triangle is half the hypotenuse, and the length of the longer leg is $\sqrt{3}$ times the length of the shorter leg.  We apply these facts to each triangle, starting with $\triangle AOB$ and working clockwise.

From $\triangle AOB$, we find $AB = AO/2 = 8$ and $BO = AB\sqrt{3}=8\sqrt{3}$.

From $\triangle BOC$, we find $BC = BO/2 =4\sqrt{3}$ and $CO = BC\sqrt{3} =4\sqrt{3}\cdot\sqrt{3} = \boxed{12}$.",1,0.0039571499999999996
