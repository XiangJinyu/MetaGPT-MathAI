"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","Let the measure of each of the two congruent acute angles be denoted as \( x \). Since there are two such angles, their total contribution to the sum of the interior angles of the pentagon is \( 2x \).

According to the problem, the measure of each of the other three angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. Therefore, each of the three remaining angles measures \( 2x \).

Now, we can express the total sum of the interior angles of the pentagon. The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides is given by:

\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
\]

For a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)):

\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
\]

Now, we can set up the equation for the sum of the angles in the pentagon:

\[
2x + 3(2x) = 540^\circ
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x + 6x = 540^\circ
\]

Combining like terms gives:

\[
8x = 540^\circ
\]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 8:

\[
x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
\]

Now, we can find the measure of the larger angles, which is \( 2x \):

\[
2x = 2 \times 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ
\]

Thus, the common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is:

\[
\boxed{135}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.0013903499999999998

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
n+1 & 1 & n-1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

In a magic square, the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each diagonal must be equal. We will calculate the sums of the rows and set them equal to each other.

**Row 1:**
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
\]

**Row 2:**
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
\]

**Row 3:**
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]

Setting the sums of Row 1 and Row 2 equal:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Rearranging gives:
\[
1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n \implies n = 7
\]

Next, we will verify that this value of \( n \) satisfies the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals.

Substituting \( n = 7 \) into the square:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
7-3 & 7+2 & 2 \\
3 & 2(7)-9 & 7 \\
7+1 & 1 & 7-1
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
4 & 9 & 2 \\
3 & 5 & 7 \\
8 & 1 & 6
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Now we calculate the sums:

**Row Sums:**
- Row 1: \( 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \)
- Row 2: \( 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \)
- Row 3: \( 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \)

**Column Sums:**
- Column 1: \( 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \)
- Column 2: \( 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \)
- Column 3: \( 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \)

**Diagonal Sums:**
- Main diagonal: \( 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)
- Other diagonal: \( 2 + 5 + 8 = 15 \)

Since all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to 15, the value of \( n \) is confirmed to be correct.

Thus, the value of \( n \) is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To determine how many bad workers you need to hire along with the 3 good workers to paint your house in 3 hours, we first need to calculate the work rates of both types of workers.

1. **Work Rate of Good Workers:**
   Each good worker can paint the house in 12 hours. Therefore, the work rate of one good worker is:
   \[
   \text{Work rate of one good worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
   \]
   For 3 good workers, the combined work rate is:
   \[
   \text{Combined work rate of 3 good workers} = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses per hour}
   \]

2. **Work Rate of Bad Workers:**
   Each bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours. Therefore, the work rate of one bad worker is:
   \[
   \text{Work rate of one bad worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
   \]

3. **Total Work Required:**
   You need to paint 1 house in 3 hours. Therefore, the required work rate to complete the house in that time is:
   \[
   \text{Required work rate} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{3 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ houses per hour}
   \]

4. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of bad workers you need to hire. The combined work rate of the bad workers is:
   \[
   \text{Combined work rate of } x \text{ bad workers} = x \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{x}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
   \]
   The total work rate from both good and bad workers must equal the required work rate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} + \frac{x}{36} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

5. **Solving the Equation:**
   To solve for \( x \), first find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 4, 36, and 3 is 36. Rewrite the equation:
   \[
   \frac{9}{36} + \frac{x}{36} = \frac{12}{36}
   \]
   Now, combine the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{9 + x}{36} = \frac{12}{36}
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 36:
   \[
   9 + x = 12
   \]
   Subtract 9 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 3
   \]

Thus, you need to hire **3 bad workers** in addition to the 3 good workers to paint your house in 3 hours.","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",0,0.0024631499999999995
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To find a common English word with a product value of 715, we first need to factor 715 into its prime factors. 

The prime factorization of 715 is:
- 715 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
- The sum of the digits of 715 (7 + 1 + 5 = 13) is not divisible by 3, so 715 is not divisible by 3.
- 715 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5: 
  \[
  715 \div 5 = 143
  \]
- Next, we factor 143. It is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. Checking for 7:
  \[
  143 \div 7 \approx 20.43 \quad (\text{not divisible})
  \]
- Checking for 11:
  \[
  143 \div 11 = 13 \quad (\text{exactly divisible})
  \]
Thus, the complete factorization of 715 is:
\[
715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
\]

Next, we need to map these factors to letters:
- 5 corresponds to E
- 11 corresponds to K
- 13 corresponds to M

Now, we can form the word using these letters. The letters E, K, and M can be arranged to form the word ""MEK"" or ""KEM"", but these are not common English words. 

However, if we consider the letters in different combinations, we can also check for other combinations of letters that might yield the same product value. 

After checking various combinations, we find that the word ""ME"" (M = 13, E = 5) does not yield the product of 715, but if we include the letter ""A"" (A = 1), we can check:
- The product value of ""ME"" is 13 * 5 = 65, which is not 715.

Continuing to explore combinations, we find that the word ""KID"" (K = 11, I = 9, D = 4) gives us:
- The product value of ""KID"" is 11 * 9 * 4 = 396, which is also not 715.

After checking various combinations, we find that the word ""KEM"" (K = 11, E = 5, M = 13) gives us:
- The product value of ""KEM"" is 11 * 5 * 13 = 715.

Thus, the common English word with a product value of 715 is **""KEM""**.","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}
(5)\cdot (11) \cdot (13) &= 5\cdot 11\cdot 13 \\
(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.",0,0.0008267999999999999
Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"To estimate \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred, we can first round \( 14.7923412 \) to a simpler number. 

Rounding \( 14.7923412 \) to the nearest whole number gives us \( 15 \).

Next, we calculate \( 15^2 \):

\[
15^2 = 225
\]

Now, we need to determine if \( 14.7923412^2 \) is closer to \( 200 \) or \( 300 \). 

To do this, we can calculate \( 14.7923412^2 \) more accurately:

\[
14.7923412^2 \approx 219.999
\]

Since \( 219.999 \) is closer to \( 200 \) than to \( 300 \), we round \( 219.999 \) to the nearest hundred, which is \( 200 \).

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","Let the side length of the square be \( s \). Given that the area of the square is \( 49 \) square inches, we can find \( s \) as follows:

\[
s^2 = 49 \implies s = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, we can visualize the square as having corners labeled \( A, B, C, D \) in clockwise order. Suppose we fold the square such that corner \( A \) coincides with corner \( C \).

The fold line will be the line segment connecting the midpoints of sides \( AB \) and \( CD \). The midpoints of these sides are:

- Midpoint of \( AB \): \( M_1 = \left( \frac{0 + 7}{2}, \frac{0 + 0}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{7}{2}, 0 \right) \)
- Midpoint of \( CD \): \( M_2 = \left( \frac{0 + 7}{2}, \frac{7 + 7}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{7}{2}, 7 \right) \)

The fold line is vertical and runs through \( x = \frac{7}{2} \).

When the square is folded, the triangle formed has vertices at \( A \), \( B \), and \( M_1 \). The coordinates of these points are:

- \( A = (0, 0) \)
- \( B = (7, 0) \)
- \( M_1 = \left( \frac{7}{2}, 0 \right) \)

To find the lengths of the sides of triangle \( ABM_1 \):

1. **Length of \( AB \)**:
   \[
   AB = 7 - 0 = 7 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Length of \( AM_1 \)**:
   \[
   AM_1 = \sqrt{\left( \frac{7}{2} - 0 \right)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \frac{7}{2} \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Length of \( BM_1 \)**:
   \[
   BM_1 = \sqrt{\left( \frac{7}{2} - 7 \right)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{\left( -\frac{7}{2} \right)^2} = \frac{7}{2} \text{ inches}
   \]

Now, we can calculate the perimeter of triangle \( ABM_1 \):

\[
\text{Perimeter} = AB + AM_1 + BM_1 = 7 + \frac{7}{2} + \frac{7}{2}
\]

Combining the lengths:

\[
\text{Perimeter} = 7 + \frac{7}{2} + \frac{7}{2} = 7 + 7 = 14 \text{ inches}

Thus, the perimeter of one of the triangles is:

So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.0018118499999999998
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To find the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships, we need to consider the handshakes that occur between players of different teams and those that occur within the same team.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of players
There are 3 teams, each with 4 players. Therefore, the total number of players is:
\[
3 \times 4 = 12
\]

### Step 2: Handshakes within the same team
Each player shakes hands once with each of their own teammates. Since there are 4 players on each team, the number of handshakes within one team can be calculated using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \), which gives the number of ways to choose 2 players from \( n \) players to shake hands. For one team:
\[
\text{Handshakes within one team} = \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
\]
Since there are 3 teams, the total number of handshakes within all teams is:
\[
3 \times 6 = 18
\]

### Step 3: Handshakes between different teams
Each player shakes hands 3 times with every member of the opposing teams. Each team has 4 players, and there are 2 opposing teams for each team. Therefore, each player shakes hands with:
\[
4 \text{ (players from Team 1)} + 4 \text{ (players from Team 2)} = 8 \text{ players}
\]
Since each player shakes hands 3 times with each of these 8 players, the total number of handshakes for one player with players from opposing teams is:
\[
3 \times 8 = 24
\]
Now, since there are 12 players in total, the total number of handshakes between players from different teams is:
\[
\frac{12 \times 24}{2} = 144
\]
We divide by 2 because each handshake is counted twice (once for each participant).

### Step 4: Total handshakes
Now, we can add the handshakes within teams and the handshakes between teams:
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = \text{Handshakes within teams} + \text{Handshakes between teams} = 18 + 144 = 162
\]

Thus, the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships is:
\[
\boxed{162}
\]","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

There are 12 players in total, which offers $12\times27=324$ handshakes, but since a handshake takes place between two people, we've counted every handshake twice.

The final answer is $\dfrac{324}{2}=\boxed{162}$ handshakes.",1,0.0004768499999999999
"The expression $2\cdot 3 \cdot 4\cdot 5+1$ is equal to 121, since multiplication is carried out before addition. However, we can obtain values other than 121 for this expression if we are allowed to change it by inserting parentheses. For example, we can obtain 144 by writing \[
(2\cdot (3\cdot 4)) \cdot (5+1) = 144.
\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).","To find the different values that can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses, we first need to analyze the multiplication part of the expression, which is \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5\).

The multiplication can be grouped in various ways by inserting parentheses. The possible groupings can be represented as binary trees, where each internal node represents a multiplication operation. The expression can be grouped in the following ways:

1. \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5)\)
2. \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5\)
3. \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5\)
4. \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5))\)
5. \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5\)

We will calculate the value of \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5\) first:

\[
2 \cdot 3 = 6,
\]
\[
6 \cdot 4 = 24,
\]
\[
24 \cdot 5 = 120.
\]

Thus, the original expression evaluates to:

\[
120 + 1 = 121.
\]

Next, we will evaluate the different groupings:

1. **Grouping: \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5)\)**

   \[
   (2 \cdot 3) = 6,
   \]
   \[
   (4 \cdot 5) = 20,
   \]
   \[
   6 \cdot 20 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 120 + 1 = 121.
   \]

2. **Grouping: \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5\)**

   \[
   (3 \cdot 4) = 12,
   \]
   \[
   2 \cdot 12 = 24,
   \]
   \[
   24 \cdot 5 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 120 + 1 = 121.
   \]

3. **Grouping: \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5\)**

   This is equivalent to the first grouping, so it gives:
   \[
   120 + 1 = 121.
   \]

4. **Grouping: \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5))\)**

   \[
   (4 \cdot 5) = 20,
   \]
   \[
   (3 \cdot 20) = 60,
   \]
   \[
   2 \cdot 60 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 120 + 1 = 121.
   \]

5. **Grouping: \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5\)**

   \[
   (3 \cdot 4) = 12,
   \]
   \[
   12 \cdot 5 = 60,
   \]
   \[
   2 \cdot 60 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 120 + 1 = 121.
   \]

Now, we can also consider other groupings that involve different arrangements of parentheses:

- **Grouping: \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5\)**

   This is equivalent to the previous calculations, yielding:
   \[
   120 + 1 = 121.
   \]

- **Grouping: \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5)\)**

   This also yields:
   \[
   120 + 1 = 121.
   \]

Next, we can also consider the following grouping:

- **Grouping: \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 + 5)\)**

   \[
   (4 + 5) = 9,
   \]
   \[
   6 \cdot 9 = 54 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 54 + 1 = 55.
   \]

- **Grouping: \((2 + 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5)\)**

   \[
   (2 + 3) = 5,
   \]
   \[
   5 \cdot 20 = 100 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 100 + 1 = 101.
   \]

- **Grouping: \((2 + 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5\)**

   \[
   (3 \cdot 4) = 12,
   \]
   \[
   (2 + 12) = 14,
   \]
   \[
   14 \cdot 5 = 70 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 70 + 1 = 71.
   \]

- **Grouping: \(2 \cdot (3 + 4) \cdot 5\)**

   \[
   (3 + 4) = 7,
   \]
   \[
   2 \cdot 7 = 14,
   \]
   \[
   14 \cdot 5 = 70 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 70 + 1 = 71.
   \]

After evaluating all possible groupings, we find the distinct results:

- \(121\)
- \(55\)
- \(101\)
- \(71\)

Thus, the total number of distinct values obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses is:

\]","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.

"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To determine the total number of different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we need to consider each component and how many choices he has for each.

1. **Hairstyles**: Tom has 3 options (including the option to be bald, which counts as a fourth option). So, he has:
   \[
   3 \text{ (hairstyles)} + 1 \text{ (bald)} = 4 \text{ options}
   \]

2. **Eyebrows**: There are 2 sets of eyebrows, so he has:
   \[
   2 \text{ options}
   \]

3. **Eyes**: There is 1 pair of googly eyes, so he has:
   \[
   1 \text{ option}
   \]

4. **Ears**: There are 2 sets of ears, so he has:
   \[
   2 \text{ options}
   \]

5. **Lips**: There are 2 sets of lips, so he has:
   \[
   2 \text{ options}
   \]

6. **Shoes**: Tom has a pair of regular shoes and a bonus pair of clown shoes, giving him:
   \[
   2 \text{ options}
   \]

Now, to find the total number of different combinations, we multiply the number of options for each component together:

\[
\text{Total combinations} = (\text{hairstyles}) \times (\text{eyebrows}) \times (\text{eyes}) \times (\text{ears}) \times (\text{lips}) \times (\text{shoes})
\]

Substituting in the numbers we calculated:

\[
\text{Total combinations} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. \(8 \times 1 = 8\)
3. \(8 \times 2 = 16\)
4. \(16 \times 2 = 32\)
5. \(32 \times 2 = 64\)

Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities Tom can come up with is:

\[
\boxed{64}
\]","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.00114705
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To find how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0, we can break this down into two cases based on the position of the digit 0.

### Case 1: 3-digit numbers (100 to 999)
In this case, we can have the digit 0 in the tens or the units place.

#### Subcase 1.1: 0 in the tens place
The number can be represented as \( \overline{a0b} \), where:
- \( a \) (the hundreds digit) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \( b \) (the units digit) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).

Thus, the total for this subcase is:
\[
9 \times 9 = 81
\]

#### Subcase 1.2: 0 in the units place
The number can be represented as \( \overline{ab0} \), where:
- \( a \) (the hundreds digit) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \( b \) (the tens digit) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).

Thus, the total for this subcase is:
\[
9 \times 9 = 81
\]

### Total for 3-digit numbers
Adding both subcases together, we have:
\[
81 + 81 = 162
\]

### Case 2: 2-digit numbers (100 to 999)
Since we are only considering numbers between 99 and 999, there are no 2-digit numbers that can contain a 0. Therefore, this case contributes 0.

### Final Count
The total number of whole numbers between 99 and 999 that contain exactly one 0 is:
\[
\boxed{162}
\]","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.0020513999999999997
