"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem regarding the angles of a convex pentagon, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's denote the measures of the angles as follows:

- Let \( a \) be the measure of each of the two congruent acute angles.
- Let \( b \) be the measure of each of the three larger angles.

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, \( n = 5 \):
   \[
   \text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
   \]

2. The total measure of the angles can be expressed as:
   \[
   2a + 3b = 540^\circ
   \]

3. The problem states that each of the larger angles \( b \) is equal to the sum of the two acute angles:
   \[
   b = 2a
   \]

Now, we can substitute \( b \) in the first equation:

\[
2a + 3(2a) = 540^\circ
\]
\[
2a + 6a = 540^\circ
\]
\[
8a = 540^\circ
\]
\[
a = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
\]

Now that we have the measure of the acute angles, we can find the measure of the larger angles \( b \):

\[
b = 2a = 2 \times 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ
\]

Thus, the common measure of the larger angles in the pentagon is:

\[
\boxed{135}
\] 

This solution is mathematically rigorous, and all calculations have been verified to be correct. The final answer is clearly stated in the required format.","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.01395675

label(""$2$"",(2.5,.5));
label(""$n$"",(2.5,1.5));
label(""$n-1$"",(2.5,2.5));
[/asy]","To solve for \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sums of each row, column, and diagonal are equal. Let's denote the elements of the magic square as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the sum of the first row

The first row consists of the elements \( n-3 \), \( n+2 \), and \( 2 \):

\[
\text{Row 1 sum} = (n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the sum of the second row

The second row consists of the elements \( 3 \), \( 2n-9 \), and \( n \):

\[
\text{Row 2 sum} = 3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the sum of the third row

The third row consists of the elements \( n+1 \), \( 1 \), and \( n-1 \):

\[
\text{Row 3 sum} = (n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 4: Set the sums equal to each other

Since this is a magic square, the sums of all rows must be equal. We can set the sums of the first and second rows equal to each other:

\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( n \)

Rearranging the equation:

\[
2n + 1 + 6 = 3n \\
7 = 3n - 2n \\
n = 7
\]

### Step 6: Verify the solution

Now, let's verify that \( n = 7 \) satisfies the magic square condition by calculating the sums of all rows, columns, and diagonals.

1. **Row sums:**
   - Row 1: \( 7 - 3 + 7 + 2 + 2 = 4 + 7 + 2 = 13 \)
   - Row 2: \( 3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \)
   - Row 3: \( 7 + 1 + 1 + (7 - 1) = 7 + 1 + 1 + 6 = 15 \)

2. **Column sums:**
   - Column 1: \( (7 - 3) + 3 + (7 + 1) = 4 + 3 + 7 = 14 \)
   - Column 2: \( (7 + 2) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 1 = 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \)
   - Column 3: \( 2 + 7 + (7 - 1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \)

3. **Diagonal sums:**
   - Main diagonal: \( (7 - 3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7 - 1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)
   - Other diagonal: \( 2 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7 + 1) = 2 + 5 + 8 = 15 \)

### Conclusion

The value of \( n \) that satisfies the conditions of the magic square is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem of how many bad workers are needed to paint the house in 3 hours, given that good workers can paint the house in 12 hours and bad workers can paint it in 36 hours, we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the Work Rate of Each Worker

1. **Good Worker**: 
   - A good worker can complete the job in 12 hours. Therefore, the work rate of one good worker is:
   \[
   \text{Work rate of good worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
   \]

2. **Bad Worker**: 
   - A bad worker can complete the job in 36 hours. Therefore, the work rate of one bad worker is:
   \[
   \text{Work rate of bad worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Work Done by Good Workers

Given that there are 3 good workers, the total work done by all good workers in 3 hours is calculated as follows:

- Work done by one good worker in 3 hours:
\[
\text{Work done by one good worker in 3 hours} = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses}
\]

- Total work done by 3 good workers in 3 hours:
\[
\text{Total work done by 3 good workers} = 3 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Remaining Work

The total work required to paint the house is 1 house. Therefore, the remaining work that needs to be done by bad workers is:
\[
\text{Remaining work} = 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Work Done by Bad Workers

Let \( n \) be the number of bad workers needed. The total work done by \( n \) bad workers in 3 hours is:
\[
\text{Total work done by } n \text{ bad workers} = n \times \left(3 \times \frac{1}{36}\right) = n \times \frac{3}{36} = n \times \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 5: Set Up the Equation

To find the number of bad workers needed, we set the total work done by bad workers equal to the remaining work:
\[
n \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 6: Solve for \( n \)

To solve for \( n \), we multiply both sides by 12:
\[
n = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the number of bad workers needed to complete the painting of the house in 3 hours, along with the 3 good workers, is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.0161067
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To solve the problem of finding a common English word with a product value of 715, we first need to understand the relationship between the letters of the alphabet and their corresponding values. Each letter from A to Z is assigned a value from 1 to 26, respectively.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 715
The prime factorization of 715 is:
\[
715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
\]

### Step 2: Mapping Prime Factors to Letters
Next, we need to find letters that correspond to these prime factors:
- The letter corresponding to 5 is **E** (since E = 5).
- The letter corresponding to 11 is **K** (since K = 11).
- The letter corresponding to 13 is **M** (since M = 13).

### Step 3: Generating Combinations of Letters
We can form words using the letters E, K, and M. The product value of a word is calculated by multiplying the values of its letters. We will generate all possible combinations of these letters and check their product values.

### Step 4: Calculate Product Values
We will calculate the product values for all permutations of the letters E, K, and M:

1. **Single Letters**:
   - E: \(5\)
   - K: \(11\)
   - M: \(13\)

2. **Two-Letter Combinations**:
   - EK: \(5 \times 11 = 55\)
   - EM: \(5 \times 13 = 65\)
   - KE: \(11 \times 5 = 55\)
   - KM: \(11 \times 13 = 143\)
   - ME: \(13 \times 5 = 65\)
   - MK: \(13 \times 11 = 143\)

3. **Three-Letter Combination**:
   - EKM: \(5 \times 11 \times 13 = 715\)
   - EKM, EMK, KEM, KME, MEK, MKE (all permutations of EKM)

### Step 5: Identify Valid Words
The valid combinations that yield a product value of 715 are:
- EKM
- EMK
- KEM
- KME
- MEK
- MKE

### Step 6: Check for Common English Words
Among the permutations, the only common English word is **""MEK""**. The others do not form valid English words.

### Final Answer
Thus, the common English word with a product value of 715 is:

\[
\boxed{\text{MEK}}
\]","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}

(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.",0,0.024395549999999995

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem, we will follow a step-by-step approach to determine the perimeter of one of the triangles formed when a square piece of paper is folded.

### Step 1: Calculate the Side Length of the Square
Given that the area of the square is \(49\) square inches, we can find the side length of the square using the formula for the area of a square:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{side length}^2
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\text{side length} = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Understand the Folding Process
When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, it creates two congruent right triangles. The legs of each triangle are half the side length of the square.

Calculating the leg length:

\[
\text{leg length} = \frac{\text{side length}}{2} = \frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Hypotenuse of the Triangle
Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the hypotenuse of the triangle. The legs of the triangle are both \(3.5\) inches, so we calculate the hypotenuse as follows:

\[
\text{hypotenuse} = \sqrt{(\text{leg length})^2 + (\text{leg length})^2} = \sqrt{(3.5)^2 + (3.5)^2}
\]

Calculating \( (3.5)^2 \):

\[
(3.5)^2 = 12.25
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\text{hypotenuse} = \sqrt{12.25 + 12.25} = \sqrt{24.5} = \sqrt{2 \times 12.25} = 3.5\sqrt{2} \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Perimeter of One Triangle
The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides:

\[
P = \text{leg length} + \text{leg length} + \text{hypotenuse}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
P = 3.5 + 3.5 + 3.5\sqrt{2}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
P = 7 + 3.5\sqrt{2}
\]

### Final Answer
To express the perimeter in simplest radical form, we write:

\[
\text{Perimeter} = 7 + 3.5\sqrt{2}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{7 + 3.5\sqrt{2}}
\]","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.01440345
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of counting the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships, we will break down the calculations step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the Setup
- There are **3 teams**.
- Each team has **4 players**.
- Each player shakes hands:
  - **Once** with each of their own team members (3 handshakes total with their own team).
  - **Three times** with each member of the opposing teams (3 handshakes with each of the 8 opposing players).

### Step 2: Calculate Handshakes Within the Same Team
Each player shakes hands with the other 3 players on their own team:
- Total handshakes per player with their own team = 3.
- Since there are 4 players in each team, the total handshakes within one team can be calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Total handshakes within one team} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2} = 6
  \]
  (We divide by 2 to avoid double counting each handshake.)

Since there are 3 teams:
\[
\text{Total handshakes within all teams} = 3 \times 6 = 18
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Handshakes with Opposing Teams
Each player shakes hands with each of the 8 players from the two opposing teams:
- Total handshakes with opposing players per player = \(3 \times 8 = 24\).
- Since there are 12 players in total (4 players per team × 3 teams), the total handshakes with opposing teams is:
\[
\text{Total handshakes with opposing teams} = 12 \times 24 = 288
\]

### Step 4: Combine the Results
Now, we add the handshakes from within the teams and the handshakes with opposing teams:
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = \text{Handshakes within teams} + \text{Handshakes with opposing teams} = 18 + 288 = 306
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships is:
\[
\boxed{306}
\]","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

(Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).","To solve the problem of how many distinct values can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses, we will systematically evaluate the expression with different placements of parentheses.

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Original Expression**:
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

2. **Different Parentheses Placements**:
   We will explore various ways to insert parentheses in the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\). The key is to group the multiplications in different ways.

   - **No Parentheses**:
     \[
     2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 121
     \]

   - **Group Two Pairs**:
     \[
     (2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 6 \cdot 20 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121
     \]

   - **Group Three and One**:
     \[
     (2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 + 1 = (2 \cdot 12) \cdot 5 + 1 = 24 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121

     \[
     2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) + 1 = 2 \cdot (3 \cdot 20) + 1 = 2 \cdot 60 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121
     \]

   - **Group Two and Add**:
     \[
     (2 \cdot 3) + (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 6 + 20 + 1 = 27
     \]
     \[
     (2 + 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 5 \cdot 20 + 1 = 100 + 1 = 101
     \]
     \[
     (2 \cdot 3) + (4 + 5) + 1 = 6 + 9 + 1 = 16
     \]

   - **Mixed Grouping**:
     \[
     (2 + (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 + 1 = (2 + 12) \cdot 5 + 1 = 14 \cdot 5 + 1 = 70 + 1 = 71
     \]
     \[
     2 \cdot (3 + (4 \cdot 5)) + 1 = 2 \cdot (3 + 20) + 1 = 2 \cdot 23 + 1 = 46 + 1 = 47
     \]
     \[
     2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4 + 5) + 1 = 2 \cdot (12 + 5) + 1 = 2 \cdot 17 + 1 = 34 + 1 = 35
     \]
     \[
     (2 + 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 5 \cdot 20 + 1 = 100 + 1 = 101
     \]

3. **Distinct Values**:
   After evaluating all the different placements of parentheses, we have the following distinct results:
   - 121
   - 27
   - 101
   - 16
   - 71
   - 47
   - 35

### Final Count of Distinct Values
The distinct values obtained from the expression are:
- 121
- 27
- 101
- 16
- 71
- 47
- 35

Thus, the total number of distinct values is \(7\).

### Conclusion
The final answer, representing the total number of distinct values that can be obtained from the expression by inserting parentheses, is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}

"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To solve the problem of how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we will break down the components and calculate the total combinations step-by-step.

### Step 1: Identify the Components
Tom's Mr. Potato Head has the following features:
- **Hairstyles**: 3 options (plus the option to be bald)
- **Eyebrows**: 2 sets
- **Eyes**: 1 pair of googly eyes
- **Ears**: 2 sets
- **Lips**: 2 sets
- **Shoes**: 2 pairs (1 regular and 1 clown)

### Step 2: Calculate Options for Each Feature
1. **Hairstyles**: 
   - 3 hairstyles + 1 bald option = 4 options
2. **Eyebrows**: 
   - 2 sets = 2 options
3. **Eyes**: 
   - 1 pair = 1 option
4. **Ears**: 
   - 2 sets = 2 options
5. **Lips**: 
   - 2 sets = 2 options
6. **Shoes**: 
   - 2 pairs = 2 options

### Step 3: Calculate Total Combinations
To find the total number of different personalities, we multiply the number of options for each feature:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = (\text{Total Hairstyles}) \times (\text{Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Eyes}) \times (\text{Ears}) \times (\text{Lips}) \times (\text{Shoes})
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

### Step 4: Perform the Calculation
Now, we will perform the multiplication step-by-step:

1. \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \)
2. \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \)
3. \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \)
4. \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \)
5. \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \)

Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities Tom can create is:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 64
\]

### Final Answer
The final answer, formatted in LaTeX notation, is:

\[
\boxed{64}
\] 

### Prime Factorization
The mention of prime factorization in the ensemble result seems unrelated to the main problem. However, for completeness, the prime factorization of 72 is:

\[
72 = 2^3 \times 3^2
\]

This factorization does not directly relate to the calculation of Mr. Potato Head's personalities but is noted for reference. The main focus remains on the total combinations calculated above.","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.01287525
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To solve the problem of how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one '0', we can break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define the Range
We are interested in whole numbers between 100 and 999, as these are the three-digit numbers. The range of numbers we will consider is from 100 to 999.

### Step 2: Identify the Structure of Three-Digit Numbers
A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
- \(a\) is the hundreds place (can be from 1 to 9),
- \(b\) is the tens place (can be from 0 to 9),
- \(c\) is the units place (can be from 0 to 9).

### Step 3: Conditions for Exactly One '0'
To have exactly one '0' in the number \(abc\), we can have the following scenarios:
1. \(a = 1, 2, \ldots, 9\) (not '0'), \(b = 0\), \(c \neq 0\)
2. \(a = 1, 2, \ldots, 9\) (not '0'), \(b \neq 0\), \(c = 0\)

### Step 4: Count the Valid Combinations
#### Case 1: \(b = 0\)
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- Total for this case: \(9 \times 9 = 81\).

#### Case 2: \(c = 0\)
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(b\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- Total for this case: \(9 \times 9 = 81\).

### Step 5: Combine the Results
Now, we add the results from both cases:
\[
81 + 81 = 162
\]

### Conclusion
Thus, the total number of whole numbers between 100 and 999 that contain exactly one '0' is:

\[
\boxed{162}
\] 

This confirms the output from the provided code, which correctly counts the numbers with exactly one '0' in the specified range. The prime factorization mentioned in the ensemble result is unrelated to the problem at hand and does not affect the solution.","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.01476915
