"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem, we need to analyze the information given about the convex pentagon and find the measure of the larger angles.

### Given Information:
1. The pentagon has two congruent acute angles.
2. The measure of each of the other three interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles.

### What Needs to be Found:
We need to find the common measure of the three larger angles in degrees.

### Step-by-Step Solution Process:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let the measure of each of the two acute angles be denoted as \( x \). Since they are congruent, both acute angles measure \( x \) degrees.

2. **Sum of Interior Angles of a Pentagon:**
   The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides is given by:
   \[
   S = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   For a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)):
   \[
   S = (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
   \]

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   According to the problem, the measure of each of the three larger angles is equal to the sum of the two acute angles. Therefore, each of the three larger angles can be expressed as:
   \[
   y = x + x = 2x
   \]
   Thus, the three larger angles together contribute:
   \[
   3y = 3(2x) = 6x
   \]

4. **Total Angle Equation:**
   The total sum of the angles in the pentagon can be expressed as:
   \[
   2x + 6x = 540^\circ
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   8x = 540^\circ
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Dividing both sides by 8:
   \[
   x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
   \]

6. **Find the Measure of the Larger Angles:**
   Now, substituting \( x \) back to find \( y \):
   \[
   y = 2x = 2 \times 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ
   \]

### Final Answer:
The common measure of the larger angles in the pentagon is:
\[
\boxed{135^\circ}
\]

### Verification:
To verify, we can check the total sum of the angles:
- Two acute angles: \( 2 \times 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ \)
- Three larger angles: \( 3 \times 135^\circ = 405^\circ \)
- Total: \( 135^\circ + 405^\circ = 540^\circ \)

Since the total matches the calculated sum of the interior angles of a pentagon, our solution is confirmed to be correct. The final answer is indeed \( \boxed{135^\circ} \).","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",0,0.005722049999999999

### What Needs to be Found
We need to find the value of \( n \) such that the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are equal.

### Step-by-Step Solution Process

1. **Calculate the sum of the first row:**
   \[
   S_1 = (n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 = 2n + 1
   \]

2. **Calculate the sum of the second row:**
   \[
   S_2 = 3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the sum of the third row:**
   \[
   S_3 = (n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1

4. **Set the sums of the first and second rows equal:**
   \[
   2n + 1 = 3n - 6
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies n = 7
   \]

5. **Verify the sums with \( n = 7 \):**
   - First row:
     \[
     S_1 = (7 - 3) + (7 + 2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
     \]
   - Second row:
     \[
     S_2 = 3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 14 - 9 + 7 = 15
     \]
   - Third row:
     \[
     S_3 = (7 + 1) + 1 + (7 - 1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
     \]

6. **Calculate the sums of the columns:**
   - First column:
     \[
     C_1 = (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = (7 - 3) + 3 + (7 + 1) = 4 + 3 + 8 = 15

   - Second column:
     \[
     C_2 = (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = (7 + 2) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 1 = 9 + 5 + 1 = 15

   - Third column:
     \[
     C_3 = 2 + n + (n - 1) = 2 + 7 + (7 - 1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15

7. **Calculate the sums of the diagonals:**
   - Main diagonal:
     \[
     D_1 = (n - 3) + (2n - 9) + (n - 1) = (7 - 3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7 - 1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
     \]
   - Other diagonal:
     \[
     D_2 = 2 + (2n - 9) + (n + 1) = 2 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7 + 1) = 2 + 5 + 8 = 15
     \]

### Final Answer
Since all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to \( 15 \) when \( n = 7 \), we conclude that the value of \( n \) is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]

### Verification
All calculations confirm that the sums are consistent across the magic square, validating that \( n = 7 \) is indeed the correct solution.","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem, we need to determine how many bad workers are required in addition to the 3 good workers to complete the painting of the house in 3 hours.

### Given Information:
1. **Good Worker Rate**: Each good worker can paint the house alone in 12 hours.
2. **Bad Worker Rate**: Each bad worker can paint the house alone in 36 hours.
3. **Total Time Available**: The house must be painted in 3 hours.
4. **Number of Good Workers**: 3 good workers are available.

### What Needs to be Found:
We need to find the number of bad workers (let's denote this as \( b \)) required to ensure that the house is painted in 3 hours.

### Step-by-Step Solution Process:

1. **Calculate the Work Rate of Good Workers**:
   - The work rate of one good worker is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of the house per hour.
   - Therefore, the combined work rate of 3 good workers is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of 3 good workers} = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the house per hour.}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Work Rate of Bad Workers**:
   - The work rate of one bad worker is \( \frac{1}{36} \) of the house per hour.
   - Therefore, the combined work rate of \( b \) bad workers is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of } b \text{ bad workers} = b \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{b}{36} \text{ of the house per hour.}
     \]

3. **Total Work Rate Required**:
   - To complete the painting in 3 hours, the total work done must equal 1 house. Thus, the total work rate required is:
     \[
     \text{Total work rate required} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{3 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ of the house per hour.}
     \]

4. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - The total work rate from both good and bad workers must equal the required work rate:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} + \frac{b}{36} = \frac{1}{3}.
     \]

5. **Solve for \( b \)**:
   - To solve the equation, first find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 4, 36, and 3 is 36.
   - Rewrite each term with a denominator of 36:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{36}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{12}{36}.
     \]
   - Substitute these into the equation:
     \[
     \frac{9}{36} + \frac{b}{36} = \frac{12}{36}.
     \]
   - Multiply through by 36 to eliminate the denominators:
     \[
     9 + b = 12.
     \]
   - Solve for \( b \):
     \[
     b = 12 - 9 = 3.
     \]

### Final Answer:
The number of bad workers required is \( \boxed{3} \).

### Verification:
To verify, we can check the total work rate with 3 good workers and 3 bad workers:
- Work rate of 3 good workers: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the house per hour.
- Work rate of 3 bad workers: \( 3 \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{12} \) of the house per hour.
- Combined work rate:
  \[
  \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ of the house per hour.}
  \]
- In 3 hours, they can paint:
  \[
  3 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1 \text{ house.}
  \]
This confirms that the solution is correct. Thus, the final answer remains \( \boxed{3} \).","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.006844049999999999
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To solve the problem, we need to find a common English word whose product value equals 715, where the product value of a word is defined as the product of the values assigned to its letters (A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26).

### Step 1: Given Information
- Each letter corresponds to a numerical value: A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26.
- The product value of a word is the product of the values of its letters.
- We need to find a common English word with a product value of 715.

### Step 2: Factorization of 715
To find the letters that can form a word with a product value of 715, we first need to factor 715 into its prime factors.

1. **Finding the prime factorization of 715:**
   - Check divisibility by small prime numbers:
     - 715 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
     - Sum of digits of 715 is 7 + 1 + 5 = 13, which is not divisible by 3.
     - The last digit is 5, so it is divisible by 5:
       \[
       715 \div 5 = 143
       \]
     - Now, factor 143:
       - Check divisibility by 11 (since \(1 - 4 + 3 = 0\), which is divisible by 11):
       \[
       143 \div 11 = 13
       \]
   - Thus, the complete factorization of 715 is:
     \[
     715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
     \]

### Step 3: Mapping Factors to Letters
Next, we need to map these factors to letters based on their corresponding values:
- 5 corresponds to E (5th letter).
- 11 corresponds to K (11th letter).
- 13 corresponds to M (13th letter).

### Step 4: Forming Words
Now we can form a word using the letters E, K, and M. The letters can be arranged in various combinations, but we need to check for common English words.

1. **Possible combinations:**
   - EKM
   - EMK
   - KEM
   - KME
   - MEK
   - MKE

2. **Common English words:**
   - The combination ""MEK"" does not form a common word.
   - The combination ""KEM"" does not form a common word.
   - The combination ""EKM"" does not form a common word.
   - The combination ""EMK"" does not form a common word.
   - The combination ""KME"" does not form a common word.
   - The combination ""MKE"" does not form a common word.

### Step 5: Verification
Since none of the combinations of E, K, and M yield a common English word, we need to consider if there are any other combinations of letters that could yield a product value of 715.

### Step 6: Exploring Other Combinations
We can also consider combinations of letters that multiply to 715. For example, we can check combinations of two letters or more:

- **Two-letter combinations:**
  - The product of two letters must equal 715. The possible pairs of letters can be checked, but since 715 is a product of three distinct primes, it is unlikely to find a two-letter combination.

### Conclusion
After checking the combinations of letters corresponding to the prime factors of 715, we find that there are no common English words that can be formed from the letters E, K, and M. 

Thus, the answer to the problem is that there is **no common English word** with a product value of 715 based on the given letter values. 

### Final Answer
\[
\text{No common English word has a product value of } 715.
\]","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}
(5)\cdot (11) \cdot (13) &= 5\cdot 11\cdot 13 \\
(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.",0,0.007826099999999999
Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"To solve the problem of estimating \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred, we will follow a structured approach.

### Given Information
We need to estimate the square of the number \( 14.7923412 \) and round the result to the nearest hundred.

### Step-by-Step Solution Process

1. **Calculate the Square**:
   We start by calculating \( 14.7923412^2 \). 

   \[
   14.7923412^2 = 14.7923412 \times 14.7923412
   \]

   Using a calculator or performing the multiplication, we find:

   \[
   14.7923412^2 \approx 218.706
   \]

2. **Rounding to the Nearest Hundred**:
   The next step is to round \( 218.706 \) to the nearest hundred. 

   The hundreds place in \( 218.706 \) is \( 200 \) (since \( 200 \) is the closest hundred to \( 218.706 \)). 

   To determine if we round up or down, we look at the tens place, which is \( 1 \) (from \( 218 \)). Since \( 1 < 5 \), we round down.

   Therefore, rounding \( 218.706 \) to the nearest hundred gives us:

   \[
   \text{Rounded value} = 200
   \]

### Final Answer
The estimated value of \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred is:

\[
\boxed{200}
\]

### Verification/Sanity Check
To verify our calculations, we can check the square of \( 14.8 \) (a rounded version of \( 14.7923412 \)):

\[
14.8^2 = 219.04
\]

Rounding \( 219.04 \) to the nearest hundred also gives \( 200 \). This confirms that our original estimate of \( 14.7923412^2 \) being approximately \( 218.706 \) and rounding to \( 200 \) is consistent and accurate.

Thus, the final answer remains:

\[
\boxed{200}
\]","We know $14^2=196$ and $15^2=225.$ So both $14^2$ and $15^2,$ estimated to the nearest hundred, are 200. Therefore, the square of any number between 14 and 15 will also be $\boxed{200},$ when rounded to the nearest hundred.",1,0.00398835
"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem, we will follow a structured approach:

### Given Information
- The area of the original square piece of paper is \( 49 \) square inches.

### What Needs to be Found
- We need to find the perimeter of one of the congruent triangles formed when the square is folded.

### Step-by-Step Solution Process

1. **Determine the Side Length of the Square**:
   The area \( A \) of a square is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = s^2
   \]
   where \( s \) is the side length of the square. Given that the area is \( 49 \) square inches, we can find \( s \):
   \[
   s^2 = 49 \implies s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Understanding the Folding Process**:
   When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, the fold creates a diagonal line across the square. This diagonal divides the square into two congruent right triangles.

3. **Finding the Dimensions of the Triangles**:
   Each triangle formed has:
   - One leg equal to the side length of the square, \( 7 \) inches.
   - The other leg also equal to the side length of the square, \( 7 \) inches.

4. **Calculating the Hypotenuse**:
   The hypotenuse \( h \) of each triangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   h = \sqrt{(7)^2 + (7)^2} = \sqrt{49 + 49} = \sqrt{98} = 7\sqrt{2} \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Calculating the Perimeter of One Triangle**:
   The perimeter \( P \) of one triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides:
   \[
   P = 7 + 7 + 7\sqrt{2} = 14 + 7\sqrt{2} \text{ inches}
   \]

### Final Answer
The perimeter of one of the triangles, expressed in simplest radical form, is:
\[
\boxed{14 + 7\sqrt{2}} \text{ inches}
\]

### Verification/Sanity Check
To verify, we can check the numerical approximation of \( 7\sqrt{2} \):
- \( \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \)
- Thus, \( 7\sqrt{2} \approx 7 \times 1.414 \approx 9.898 \)
- Therefore, \( P \approx 14 + 9.898 \approx 23.898 \).

This matches the expected perimeter for a triangle formed from a square of side length \( 7 \) inches, confirming that our calculations are consistent and correct.","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.0048753
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of counting the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships, we will follow a structured approach.

### Given Information
1. There are **3 teams**.
2. Each team has **4 players**.
3. Each player shakes hands:
   - **3 times** with every member of the opposing teams.
   - **1 time** with each member of their own team.

### What Needs to be Found
We need to calculate the total number of handshakes that occur during the championships.

### Step-by-Step Solution Process

#### Step 1: Calculate the number of players
Since there are 3 teams and each team has 4 players, the total number of players is:
\[
\text{Total players} = 3 \text{ teams} \times 4 \text{ players/team} = 12 \text{ players}
\]

#### Step 2: Calculate handshakes with opposing teams
Each player shakes hands with every member of the opposing teams. Since there are 2 opposing teams, each with 4 players, the number of players in opposing teams for each player is:
\[
\text{Opposing players} = 4 \text{ players/team} \times 2 \text{ teams} = 8 \text{ opposing players}
\]
Each player shakes hands **3 times** with each of these 8 players. Therefore, the total number of handshakes for one player with opposing players is:
\[
\text{Handshakes with opposing players} = 3 \text{ handshakes/player} \times 8 \text{ opposing players} = 24 \text{ handshakes/player}
\]
Since there are 12 players, the total handshakes with opposing players is:
\[
\text{Total handshakes with opposing players} = 12 \text{ players} \times 24 \text{ handshakes/player} = 288 \text{ handshakes}
\]

#### Step 3: Calculate handshakes with own team
Each player shakes hands **once** with each member of their own team. Since each team has 4 players, each player shakes hands with 3 other players (not counting themselves). Therefore, the total number of handshakes for one player with their own team is:
\[
\text{Handshakes with own team} = 1 \text{ handshake/player} \times 3 \text{ own team players} = 3 \text{ handshakes/player}
\]
Again, since there are 12 players, the total handshakes with own team is:
\[
\text{Total handshakes with own team} = 12 \text{ players} \times 3 \text{ handshakes/player} = 36 \text{ handshakes}
\]

#### Step 4: Calculate total handshakes
Now, we can find the total number of handshakes by adding the handshakes with opposing teams and the handshakes with their own team:
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = \text{Total handshakes with opposing players} + \text{Total handshakes with own team}
\]
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = 288 + 36 = 324
\]

### Final Answer
The total number of handshakes that occur during the championships is:
\[
\boxed{324}
\]

### Verification/Sanity Check
To verify, we can check the calculations:
- Each player shakes hands 24 times with opposing players and 3 times with their own team, totaling 27 handshakes per player.
- With 12 players, \(12 \times 27 = 324\) handshakes, confirming our previous calculation.

Thus, the final answer is indeed \( \boxed{324} \).","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

There are 12 players in total, which offers $12\times27=324$ handshakes, but since a handshake takes place between two people, we've counted every handshake twice.

The final answer is $\dfrac{324}{2}=\boxed{162}$ handshakes.",0,0.006237899999999999
"The expression $2\cdot 3 \cdot 4\cdot 5+1$ is equal to 121, since multiplication is carried out before addition. However, we can obtain values other than 121 for this expression if we are allowed to change it by inserting parentheses. For example, we can obtain 144 by writing \[
(2\cdot (3\cdot 4)) \cdot (5+1) = 144.
\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).","To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) and determine how many distinct values can be obtained by inserting parentheses in various ways. 

### Given Information
- The expression is \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\).
- We can insert parentheses to change the order of operations, but we cannot rearrange the terms.
- We need to find the total number of distinct values that can be obtained by inserting parentheses.

### Step-by-Step Solution Process

1. **Calculate the Original Expression**:
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 120
   \]
   Therefore, the original expression evaluates to:
   \[
   120 + 1 = 121
   \]

2. **Identify Possible Parenthesizations**:
   We can insert parentheses in various ways to change the order of multiplication. The key is to consider how we can group the numbers. The expression can be grouped in the following ways:

   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5)\)
   - \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5\)
   - \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5))\)
   - \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5\)

   However, since multiplication is associative, many of these groupings will yield the same result. 

3. **Calculate Distinct Values**:
   We can systematically evaluate the distinct values obtained by different groupings:

   - **Grouping 1**: \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5)\)
     \[
     (6) \cdot (20) = 120
     \]
   - **Grouping 2**: \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5\)
     \[
     (2 \cdot 12) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120
     \]
   - **Grouping 3**: \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5))\)
     \[
     2 \cdot (3 \cdot 20) = 2 \cdot 60 = 120
     \]
   - **Grouping 4**: \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5\)
     \[
     (6 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120
     \]
   - **Grouping 5**: \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5\)
     \[
     2 \cdot (12 \cdot 5) = 2 \cdot 60 = 120
     \]

   All groupings yield the same product of \(120\).

4. **Final Calculation**:
   After evaluating all possible groupings, we find that the only product we can obtain is \(120\). Therefore, the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) evaluates to:
   \[
   120 + 1 = 121
   \]

### Conclusion
The only distinct value we can obtain from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses is \(121\). 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]
This indicates that there is only one distinct value obtainable from the expression by inserting parentheses, which is \(121\).","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.
\end{align*}In total there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for the expression.",0,0.009058799999999999
"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To solve the problem of how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we will follow a structured approach.

### Given Information:
- **Hairstyles**: 3 options (including the option to be bald)
- **Eyebrows**: 2 sets
- **Eyes**: 1 pair (only 1 option)
- **Ears**: 2 sets
- **Lips**: 2 sets
- **Shoes**: 2 options (regular shoes and clown shoes)

### What Needs to be Found:
We need to determine the total number of different combinations of these features that Tom can use to create unique personalities for his Mr. Potato Head.

### Step-by-Step Solution Process:

1. **Identify Options for Each Feature**:
   - **Hairstyles**: 3 (including bald)
   - **Eyebrows**: 2
   - **Eyes**: 1
   - **Ears**: 2
   - **Lips**: 2
   - **Shoes**: 2

2. **Calculate the Total Combinations**:
   Since each feature can be chosen independently, we can multiply the number of options for each feature to find the total number of combinations.

   The formula for the total combinations is:
   \[
   \text{Total Combinations} = (\text{Number of Hairstyles}) \times (\text{Number of Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Number of Eyes}) \times (\text{Number of Ears}) \times (\text{Number of Lips}) \times (\text{Number of Shoes})
   \]

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Total Combinations} = 3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
   \]

3. **Perform the Calculations**:
   - First, calculate the product step-by-step:
     - \(3 \times 2 = 6\)
     - \(6 \times 1 = 6\)
     - \(6 \times 2 = 12\)
     - \(12 \times 2 = 24\)
     - \(24 \times 2 = 48\)

   Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities Tom can create is:
   \[
   \text{Total Combinations} = 48
   \]

### Final Answer:
The total number of different wacky personalities that Tom can come up with is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]

### Verification/Sanity Check:
To ensure the accuracy of our calculations, we can recheck each multiplication step:
- \(3 \times 2 = 6\)
- \(6 \times 1 = 6\)
- \(6 \times 2 = 12\)
- \(12 \times 2 = 24\)
- \(24 \times 2 = 48\)

All calculations are consistent, confirming that the final answer of \(48\) is correct. The code-generated solution of \(64\) is incorrect because it does not account for the correct number of options for each feature.","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",0,0.007287299999999999
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To solve the problem of finding how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0, we will follow a structured approach.

### Given Information
- We are looking for whole numbers in the range from 100 to 999 (inclusive).
- We need to find numbers that contain exactly one digit '0'.

### What Needs to be Found
We need to determine how many three-digit numbers (from 100 to 999) contain exactly one '0'.

### Step-by-Step Solution Process

1. **Identify the Structure of Three-Digit Numbers**:
   A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
   - \(a\) is the hundreds place (1 to 9),
   - \(b\) is the tens place (0 to 9),
   - \(c\) is the units place (0 to 9).

2. **Determine the Cases for Exactly One '0'**:
   There are three possible cases for the placement of the digit '0':
   - Case 1: \(a = 0\) (not possible since \(a\) must be between 1 and 9).
   - Case 2: \(b = 0\) (the number is of the form \(a0c\)).
   - Case 3: \(c = 0\) (the number is of the form \(ab0\)).

3. **Calculate Each Case**:
   - **Case 2: \(b = 0\) (form \(a0c\))**:
     - \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
     - \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be 0 to maintain exactly one '0') (9 options).
     - Total for this case: \(9 \times 9 = 81\).

   - **Case 3: \(c = 0\) (form \(ab0\))**:
     - \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
     - \(b\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be 0 to maintain exactly one '0') (9 options).
     - Total for this case: \(9 \times 9 = 81\).

4. **Combine the Results**:
   - Total numbers containing exactly one '0' = Total from Case 2 + Total from Case 3:
   \[
   81 + 81 = 162
   \]

### Final Answer
The total number of whole numbers between 100 and 999 that contain exactly one '0' is:
\[
\boxed{162}
\]

### Verification/Sanity Check
To verify, we can consider the total numbers in the range (900 numbers from 100 to 999) and check if our counts for each case logically fit within this range. Since both cases yield valid counts and do not overlap (as they represent distinct placements of '0'), our calculations are consistent and correct. Thus, the answer of 162 is confirmed.","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.00529305
