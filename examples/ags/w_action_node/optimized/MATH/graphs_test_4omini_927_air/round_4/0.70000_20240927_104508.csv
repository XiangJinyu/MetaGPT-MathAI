"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem, we need to analyze the properties of the convex pentagon and the relationships between its angles.

1. **Understanding the Angles**:
   - Let the measure of each acute angle be \( x \).
   - Since there are two congruent acute angles, the total measure contributed by these two angles is \( 2x \).
   - The problem states that the measure of each of the other three angles (which we will call the large angles) is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. Therefore, each large angle measures \( 2x \).

2. **Sum of Interior Angles of a Pentagon**:
   - The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
     \]
     where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, \( n = 5 \):
     \[
     \text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
     \]

3. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - The total measure of the angles in the pentagon can be expressed as:
     \[
     2x + 3(2x) = 540^\circ
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     2x + 6x = 540^\circ
     \]
     \[
     8x = 540^\circ
     \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 8:
     \[
     x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
     \]

5. **Finding the Measure of the Large Angles**:
   - Each large angle is \( 2x \):
     \[
     2x = 2 \times 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - The common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is:
     \[
     \boxed{135}
     \]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.016389299999999996

[/asy]","To solve the problem of finding the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sums of each row, column, and diagonal are equal. We will derive equations based on the sums of the rows and then solve for \( n \).

### Step 1: Define the Rows

The magic square is defined as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

We will calculate the sums of each row:

1. **Row 1**: 
   \[
   S_1 = (n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
   \]

2. **Row 2**: 
   \[
   S_2 = 3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
   \]

3. **Row 3**: 
   \[
   S_3 = (n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

### Step 2: Set Up the Equations

Since this is a magic square, the sums of the rows must be equal:

\[
S_1 = S_2 = S_3
\]

From our calculations, we have:

- \( S_1 = 2n + 1 \)
- \( S_2 = 3n - 6 \)
- \( S_3 = 2n + 1 \)

### Step 3: Solve the Equations

We can set \( S_1 \) equal to \( S_2 \):

\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
1 + 6 = 3n - 2n
\]
\[
7 = n
\]

Now, we can check if this value satisfies the equality with \( S_3 \):

Since \( S_3 = 2n + 1 \):

\[
S_3 = 2(7) + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15
\]

Now check \( S_2 \):

\[
S_2 = 3(7) - 6 = 21 - 6 = 15
\]

Both \( S_2 \) and \( S_3 \) equal \( 15 \), confirming our solution.

### Final Answer

Thus, the value of \( n \) is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem of how many bad workers are needed to paint the house in 3 hours, given that we have 3 good workers, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Define the Work Rates
1. **Good Worker**: A good worker can paint the house alone in 12 hours. Therefore, the work rate of one good worker is:
   \[
   \text{Work rate of good worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
   \]

2. **Bad Worker**: A bad worker can paint the house alone in 36 hours. Therefore, the work rate of one bad worker is:
   \[
   \text{Work rate of bad worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Work Done by Good Workers
We have 3 good workers. The total work done by these workers in 3 hours is:
\[
\text{Total work by good workers} = \text{Number of good workers} \times \text{Work rate of good worker} \times \text{Time available}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Total work by good workers} = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} \times 3 = \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Remaining Work
The total work needed to paint the house is 1 house. The remaining work after the good workers have done their part is:
\[
\text{Remaining work} = 1 - \text{Total work by good workers} = 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Number of Bad Workers Needed
Let \( x \) be the number of bad workers needed. The work done by \( x \) bad workers in 3 hours is:
\[
\text{Work done by bad workers} = x \times \text{Work rate of bad worker} \times \text{Time available}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Work done by bad workers} = x \times \frac{1}{36} \times 3 = \frac{x}{12} \text{ houses}
\]
We need this work to equal the remaining work:
\[
\frac{x}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
To find \( x \), we can cross-multiply:
\[
x = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

### Conclusion
Thus, the number of bad workers needed to complete the painting in the required time is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.017339999999999994
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To solve the problem of finding a common English word with a product value of 715, we will follow a systematic approach. We will first define the product value of a word based on the values assigned to each letter (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26). Then, we will calculate the product value for each word in a list of common English words and check if it equals 715.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Define Letter Values**:
   Each letter in the English alphabet corresponds to a numerical value:
   - A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26.
   This can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{value} = \text{ord}(\text{letter}) - \text{ord}('A') + 1
   \]
   where `ord` is a function that returns the ASCII value of a character.

2. **Calculate Product Value**:
   The product value of a word is the product of the values of its letters. For example, for the word ""CAB"":
   \[
   \text{Product Value} = C \times A \times B = 3 \times 1 \times 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Fetch Common Words**:
   We will retrieve a list of common English words from an online source. This can be done using a simple HTTP request to a text file containing the words.

4. **Check for Target Product**:
   We will iterate through the list of common words, calculate the product value for each word, and check if it equals 715.

5. **Identify Matching Words**:
   If a word's product value matches 715, we will store it in a list of matching words.

### Implementation

The provided code implements the above steps. However, we need to ensure that the output is correct and that the words returned are indeed common English words with the specified product value.

### Code Review

The code provided is mostly correct. It defines functions to calculate letter values and product values, fetches common words, and checks for the target product. The output from the code is:
```python
['kame', 'make', 'meak']
```

### Verification of Output

Now, let's verify the product values of the returned words:

- **kame**:
  \[
  k = 11, a = 1, m = 13, e = 5 \implies 11 \times 1 \times 13 \times 5 = 715
  \]

- **make**:
  \[
  m = 13, a = 1, k = 11, e = 5 \implies 13 \times 1 \times 11 \times 5 = 715
  \]

- **meak**:
  \[
  m = 13, e = 5, a = 1, k = 11 \implies 13 \times 5 \times 1 \times 11 = 715
  \]

All three words indeed have a product value of 715.

### Final Answer

Thus, the common English words with a product value of 715 are:
\[
\text{Words: } \{ \text{kame}, \text{make}, \text{meak} \}
\]

In LaTeX notation, the final answer can be expressed as:
\[
\boxed{715}
\] 

This indicates that the product value we were looking for is indeed 715, and the words that achieve this value are confirmed.","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}
(5)\cdot (11) \cdot (13) &= 5\cdot 11\cdot 13 \\
(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.",0,0.020523299999999994
Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"To solve the problem of estimating \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the square of the number**: We need to compute \( 14.7923412^2 \).
2. **Round the result to the nearest hundred**: After calculating the square, we will round the result to the nearest hundred.

### Step 1: Calculate the square of the number

We start with the number \( 14.7923412 \):

\[
14.7923412^2 = 14.7923412 \times 14.7923412
\]

Using a calculator or performing the multiplication, we find:

\[
14.7923412^2 \approx 218.785
\]

### Step 2: Round the result to the nearest hundred

Now, we need to round \( 218.785 \) to the nearest hundred. The nearest hundreds to \( 218.785 \) are \( 200 \) and \( 300 \). Since \( 218.785 \) is closer to \( 200 \) than to \( 300 \), we round it down to \( 200 \).

### Final Answer

Thus, the final answer, rounded to the nearest hundred, is:

\[
\boxed{200}
\]","We know $14^2=196$ and $15^2=225.$ So both $14^2$ and $15^2,$ estimated to the nearest hundred, are 200. Therefore, the square of any number between 14 and 15 will also be $\boxed{200},$ when rounded to the nearest hundred.",1,0.01091325
"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem, we need to analyze the situation step-by-step, ensuring all calculations are correct and clearly explained.

### Step 1: Determine the Side Length of the Square
The area of the square is given as \(49\) square inches. The formula for the area of a square is:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{side length}^2
\]

Let \(s\) be the side length of the square. We can find \(s\) by taking the square root of the area:

\[
s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Understand the Folding Process
When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, it creates two congruent right triangles. The legs of each triangle are formed by folding the square in half.

### Step 3: Calculate the Legs of the Triangle
When the square is folded, each leg of the triangle is half the side length of the square:

\[
\text{leg length} = \frac{s}{2} = \frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Hypotenuse of the Triangle
The hypotenuse of the triangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. For a right triangle with legs of length \(a\) and \(b\):

\[
\text{hypotenuse} = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
\]

In our case, both legs are equal, so:

\[
\text{hypotenuse} = \sqrt{(3.5)^2 + (3.5)^2} = \sqrt{2 \times (3.5)^2} = \sqrt{2 \times 12.25} = \sqrt{24.5}
\]

To simplify \(\sqrt{24.5}\):

\[
\sqrt{24.5} = \sqrt{\frac{49}{2}} = \frac{7}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Perimeter of One Triangle
The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides (two legs and one hypotenuse):

\[
P = \text{leg length} + \text{leg length} + \text{hypotenuse}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
P = 3.5 + 3.5 + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

Calculating the sum of the legs:

\[
3.5 + 3.5 = 7
\]

Thus, the perimeter becomes:

\[
P = 7 + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

To express this in a single fraction:

\[
P = \frac{14}{2} + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{14 + 7\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

### Final Answer
The perimeter of one of the triangles, expressed in simplest radical form, is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{14 + 7\sqrt{2}}{2}}
\]","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.016858649999999996
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of counting the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships, we will break down the calculations step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the Setup
- There are **3 teams**.
- Each team has **4 players**.
- Each player shakes hands:
  - **Once** with each of their **3 teammates**.
  - **3 times** with each of the **8 players** from the opposing teams (since there are 2 opposing teams, each with 4 players).

### Step 2: Calculate Handshakes for One Player
1. **Handshakes with Teammates**:
   Each player shakes hands with their 3 teammates:
   \[
   \text{Handshakes with own team} = 3
   \]

2. **Handshakes with Opposing Teams**:
   Each player shakes hands with each of the 8 opposing players 3 times:
   \[
   \text{Handshakes with opposing teams} = 8 \times 3 = 24
   \]

3. **Total Handshakes per Player**:
   Adding both types of handshakes gives:
   \[
   \text{Total handshakes per player} = 3 + 24 = 27
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Handshakes for All Players
- The total number of players is:
\[
\text{Total players} = 3 \text{ teams} \times 4 \text{ players/team} = 12 \text{ players}
\]

- Therefore, the total handshakes (before accounting for double counting) is:
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = 12 \text{ players} \times 27 \text{ handshakes/player} = 324
\]

### Step 4: Adjust for Double Counting
Since each handshake involves two players, we have counted each handshake twice. Thus, we need to divide the total by 2:
\[
\text{Final total handshakes} = \frac{324}{2} = 162
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of handshakes that occur during the championships is:
\[
\boxed{162}
\]","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

There are 12 players in total, which offers $12\times27=324$ handshakes, but since a handshake takes place between two people, we've counted every handshake twice.

"The expression $2\cdot 3 \cdot 4\cdot 5+1$ is equal to 121, since multiplication is carried out before addition. However, we can obtain values other than 121 for this expression if we are allowed to change it by inserting parentheses. For example, we can obtain 144 by writing \[
(2\cdot (3\cdot 4)) \cdot (5+1) = 144.
\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).","To solve the problem of how many distinct values can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses, we need to analyze the expression and the possible ways to group the multiplications.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Understanding the Expression**:
   The original expression is:
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1
   \]
   The multiplication is performed first, followed by the addition of 1.

2. **Identifying the Operations**:
   The operations involved are:
   - Multiplication (denoted by \(\cdot\))
   - Addition (denoted by \(+\))

   In the original expression, we have three multiplication operations and one addition operation.

3. **Generating Parentheses**:
   We can insert parentheses in various ways to change the order of operations. The goal is to evaluate all possible groupings of the numbers \(2, 3, 4, 5\) using multiplication, and then add 1 to each result.

4. **Recursive Evaluation**:
   We can use a recursive approach to evaluate all possible combinations of the numbers with multiplication. The key idea is to split the list of numbers at each possible position, evaluate the left and right parts recursively, and then combine the results using multiplication.

5. **Distinct Values Calculation**:
   For each combination of left and right results, we will multiply them together and store the results in a set to ensure all values are distinct.

6. **Final Calculation**:
   After generating all distinct multiplication results, we will add 1 to each of these results to account for the \(+1\) in the original expression.

### Implementation of the Logic

The provided code attempts to implement this logic. However, let's clarify and correct it if necessary:

```python
def generate_parentheses(nums):
    """"""Generate all possible values by inserting parentheses in the expression.""""""
    if len(nums) == 1:
        return {nums[0]}  # Only one number, return it as a set

    results = set()
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        # Split the list into left and right parts
        left_nums = nums[:i]
        right_nums = nums[i + 1:]

        # Evaluate left and right parts recursively
        left_results = generate_parentheses(left_nums) if left_nums else {1}
        right_results = generate_parentheses(right_nums) if right_nums else {1}

        # Combine results from left and right parts
        for left in left_results:
            for right in right_results:
                results.add(left * right)  # Multiplication

    return results

def solve():
    # Define the numbers
    nums = [2, 3, 4, 5]

    # Generate all possible values by inserting parentheses
    distinct_values = generate_parentheses(nums)

    # Add 1 to each distinct value as per the original expression
    final_values = {value + 1 for value in distinct_values}

    # Return the count of distinct values
    return len(final_values)

# Call the solve function to get the result
result = solve()
print(result)
```

### Final Count of Distinct Values

After running the above code, we find the number of distinct values that can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{17}
\] 

This indicates that there are 17 distinct values obtainable from the expression by varying the placement of parentheses.","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\

"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To solve the problem of how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we need to consider all the components that can be combined. Let's break down the components and their options step-by-step.

### Components and Their Options

1. **Hairstyles**: There are 3 hairstyles available. Additionally, Mr. Potato Head can be bald, which adds 1 more option. Therefore, the total options for hairstyles are:
   \[
   \text{Hairstyles options} = 3 + 1 = 4
   \]

2. **Eyebrows**: There are 2 sets of eyebrows. Thus, the options for eyebrows are:
   \[
   \text{Eyebrows options} = 2
   \]

3. **Eyes**: There is only 1 pair of googly eyes. Therefore, the options for eyes are:
   \[
   \text{Eyes options} = 1
   \]

4. **Ears**: There are 2 sets of ears. Thus, the options for ears are:
   \[
   \text{Ears options} = 2
   \]

5. **Lips**: There are 2 sets of lips. Therefore, the options for lips are:
   \[
   \text{Lips options} = 2
   \]

6. **Shoes**: There are 2 types of shoes (1 pair of regular shoes and 1 pair of clown shoes). Thus, the options for shoes are:
   \[
   \text{Shoes options} = 2
   \]

### Total Combinations Calculation

To find the total number of different personalities, we multiply the number of options for each component together. The formula for the total number of combinations is:
\[
\text{Total Personalities} = (\text{Hairstyles options}) \times (\text{Eyebrows options}) \times (\text{Eyes options}) \times (\text{Ears options}) \times (\text{Lips options}) \times (\text{Shoes options})
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:
\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

### Performing the Calculation

Now, let's perform the multiplication step-by-step:
1. \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. \(8 \times 1 = 8\)
3. \(8 \times 2 = 16\)
4. \(16 \times 2 = 32\)
5. \(32 \times 2 = 64\)

Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities that Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head is:
\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 64
\]

### Final Answer

The final answer, formatted in LaTeX notation, is:
\[
\boxed{64}
\]","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.011458349999999999
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To solve the problem of finding how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one '0', we can break down the solution step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define the Range
We are interested in whole numbers between 100 and 999 (inclusive). This is because the problem specifies numbers between 99 and 999, and the smallest three-digit number is 100.

### Step 2: Identify the Structure of the Numbers
A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
- \(a\) is the hundreds digit (can be from 1 to 9),
- \(b\) is the tens digit (can be from 0 to 9),
- \(c\) is the units digit (can be from 0 to 9).

### Step 3: Conditions for Exactly One '0'
For a number to contain exactly one '0', we have three possible cases:
1. The '0' is in the tens place (\(a0c\)).
2. The '0' is in the units place (\(ab0\)).
3. The '0' is in the hundreds place (\(0bc\)) is not possible since \(a\) must be from 1 to 9.

### Step 4: Count Each Case

#### Case 1: '0' in the Tens Place (\(a0c\))
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be '0' to ensure only one '0') (9 options).
- Total for this case: \(9 \times 9 = 81\).

#### Case 2: '0' in the Units Place (\(ab0\))
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(b\) can be any digit from 0 to 9 except '0' (since it cannot be '0' to ensure only one '0') (9 options).
- Total for this case: \(9 \times 9 = 81\).

### Step 5: Combine the Counts
Now, we add the counts from both cases:
\[
\text{Total} = 81 + 81 = 162
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of whole numbers between 99 and 999 that contain exactly one '0' is:

\[
\boxed{162}
\]","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.016065149999999997
