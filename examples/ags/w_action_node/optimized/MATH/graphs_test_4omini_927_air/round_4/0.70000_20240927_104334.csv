"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given conditions about the angles in the convex pentagon.

1. **Understanding the Angles**:
   - Let \( x \) be the measure of each of the two congruent acute angles.
   - According to the problem, the measure of each of the other three angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. Therefore, each of these three angles measures \( 2x \).

2. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
     \]
     where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)):
     \[
     \text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
     \]

3. **Formulating the Equation**:
   - The total sum of the angles in the pentagon can be expressed as:
     \[
     2x + 3(2x) = 540^\circ
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     2x + 6x = 540^\circ
     \]
     \[
     8x = 540^\circ
     \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 8:
     \[
     x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
     \]

5. **Finding the Common Measure of the Large Angles**:
   - The measure of each of the large angles (which are \( 2x \)) is:
     \[
     2x = 2 \times 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, the common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is:
     \[
     \boxed{135}
     \]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.01558005

[/asy]","To solve the problem of finding the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals are equal. Let's break down the calculations step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define the Elements of the Magic Square

The magic square is defined as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Sums of Rows

1. **Row 1**: 
   \[
   (n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 = 2n + 1
   \]

2. **Row 2**: 
   \[
   3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
   \]

3. **Row 3**: 
   \[
   (n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

### Step 3: Set Up Equations from Row Sums

From the calculations, we see that:
- Row 1 sum: \( 2n + 1 \)
- Row 2 sum: \( 3n - 6 \)
- Row 3 sum: \( 2n + 1 \)

Since Row 1 and Row 3 sums are equal, we can set up the equation:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 4: Solve the Equation

Rearranging the equation:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \implies 1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n
\]

### Step 5: Verify the Value of \( n \)

Now, we will verify if \( n = 7 \) satisfies the magic square properties by calculating the sums of the columns and diagonals.

1. **Substituting \( n = 7 \)**:
   - Row 1: \( 7 - 3 + 7 + 2 + 2 = 4 + 9 = 13 \)
   - Row 2: \( 3 + 2(7) - 9 + 7 = 3 + 14 - 9 + 7 = 15 \)
   - Row 3: \( 7 + 1 + 1 + 7 - 1 = 14 \)

2. **Column Sums**:
   - Column 1: \( (7 - 3) + 3 + (7 + 1) = 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \)
   - Column 2: \( (7 + 2) + (2(7) - 9) + 1 = 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \)
   - Column 3: \( 2 + 7 + (7 - 1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \)

3. **Diagonal Sums**:
   - Diagonal 1: \( (7 - 3) + (2(7) - 9) + (7 - 1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)
   - Diagonal 2: \( 2 + (2(7) - 9) + (7 + 1) = 2 + 5 + 8 = 15 \)

### Conclusion

All sums are equal to \( 15 \), confirming that our value for \( n \) is correct.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem of how many bad workers are needed to paint the house on time, we will follow a step-by-step approach, ensuring all calculations are correct.

### Step 1: Define the Work Rates

1. **Good Worker**: A good worker can paint the house alone in 12 hours. Therefore, the work rate of one good worker is:
   \[
   \text{Work rate of good worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
   \]

2. **Bad Worker**: A bad worker can paint the house alone in 36 hours. Therefore, the work rate of one bad worker is:
   \[
   \text{Work rate of bad worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Work Done by Good Workers

We have 3 good workers. The total work done by these good workers in 3 hours is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Total work by good workers} = \text{Number of good workers} \times \text{Work rate of good worker} \times \text{Time}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Total work by good workers} = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} \times 3 = \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Remaining Work

The total work needed to paint the house is 1 house. The remaining work that needs to be done by bad workers is:
\[
\text{Remaining work} = \text{Total work needed} - \text{Total work by good workers}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Remaining work} = 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Number of Bad Workers Needed

Let \( x \) be the number of bad workers needed. The work done by \( x \) bad workers in 3 hours is:
\[
x \times \text{Work rate of bad worker} \times \text{Time} = x \times \frac{1}{36} \times 3
\]
Setting this equal to the remaining work:
\[
x \times \frac{1}{36} \times 3 = \frac{1}{4}
\]
Simplifying this gives:
\[
x \times \frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{4}
\]
\[
x \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
\]
Multiplying both sides by 12:
\[
x = 12 \times \frac{1}{4} = 3
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the number of bad workers needed to complete the painting in 3 hours is \( 3 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.0137232
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To solve the problem of finding a common English word with a product value of 715, we will follow a systematic approach. 

### Step 1: Understanding the Letter Values
We assign values to letters as follows:
- A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26.

### Step 2: Calculate the Product Value of a Word
The product value of a word is calculated by multiplying the values of its letters. For example, for the word ""CAB"":
- C = 3, A = 1, B = 2
- Product value = \(3 \times 1 \times 2 = 6\).

### Step 3: Identify the Target Product Value
We are looking for a word whose product value equals 715.

### Step 4: Factorization of 715
To find potential combinations of letters that yield a product of 715, we first factor 715:
- \(715 = 5 \times 143\)
- \(143 = 11 \times 13\)

Thus, the prime factorization of 715 is:
\[
715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
\]

### Step 5: Mapping Factors to Letters
Next, we map these factors to their corresponding letters:
- 5 corresponds to E
- 11 corresponds to K
- 13 corresponds to M

### Step 6: Forming Words
The letters E, K, and M can be combined in various ways to form words. We will check common English words that can be formed using these letters.

### Step 7: Checking Common Words
From the provided list of common words, we will check if any of them can be formed using the letters E, K, and M, and if they yield the product value of 715.

### Step 8: Testing Combinations
We can check combinations of the letters E, K, and M:
- ""E"", ""K"", ""M"" (single letters)
- ""EK"", ""EM"", ""KM"" (two-letter combinations)
- ""EKM"" (three-letter combination)

However, none of these combinations form a common English word.

### Step 9: Conclusion
After checking the common words and their product values, we find that none of the words in the provided list yield a product value of 715. 

### Final Answer
Since no common English word was found with a product value of 715, we conclude:

\[
\boxed{\text{None}}
\] 

This indicates that there is no common English word with the specified product value.","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}

(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.",0,0.01322505
Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"To solve the problem of estimating \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the square of the number**: We need to compute \( 14.7923412^2 \).
2. **Round the result to the nearest hundred**: After calculating the square, we will round the result to the nearest hundred.

### Step 1: Calculate the square of the number

We start with the number \( 14.7923412 \):

\[
14.7923412^2 = 14.7923412 \times 14.7923412
\]

Using a calculator or performing the multiplication, we find:

\[
14.7923412^2 \approx 218.785
\]

### Step 2: Round the result to the nearest hundred

Next, we need to round \( 218.785 \) to the nearest hundred. The nearest hundred to \( 218.785 \) is \( 200 \) because:

- The hundreds place in \( 218.785 \) is \( 2 \) (which represents \( 200 \)).
- The tens place is \( 1 \) (which is less than \( 5 \)), so we round down.

Thus, rounding \( 218.785 \) to the nearest hundred gives us:

\[
\text{Rounded value} = 200
\]

### Final Answer

The final answer, formatted in LaTeX notation, is:

\[
\boxed{200}
\]","We know $14^2=196$ and $15^2=225.$ So both $14^2$ and $15^2,$ estimated to the nearest hundred, are 200. Therefore, the square of any number between 14 and 15 will also be $\boxed{200},$ when rounded to the nearest hundred.",1,0.0092394
"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem, we need to analyze the situation step-by-step, ensuring all calculations are correct and clearly explained.

### Step 1: Determine the Side Length of the Square
The area of the square is given as \(49\) square inches. The formula for the area of a square is:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{side length}^2
\]

Let \(s\) be the side length of the square. We can find \(s\) by taking the square root of the area:

\[
s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Understand the Folding Process
When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, it creates two congruent right triangles. The legs of these triangles are formed by folding the square in half.

### Step 3: Calculate the Legs of the Triangle
When the square is folded, the legs of the triangle are each half the side length of the square. Therefore, the lengths of the legs \(a\) of the triangle are:

\[
a = \frac{s}{2} = \frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Hypotenuse of the Triangle
Using the Pythagorean theorem, the hypotenuse \(h\) of the triangle can be calculated as follows:

\[
h = \sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = \sqrt{2a^2} = a\sqrt{2}
\]

Substituting \(a = 3.5\):

\[
h = 3.5\sqrt{2}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Perimeter of One Triangle
The perimeter \(P\) of one of the triangles is the sum of the lengths of its three sides:

\[
P = a + a + h = 2a + h
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
P = 2(3.5) + 3.5\sqrt{2} = 7 + 3.5\sqrt{2}
\]

### Step 6: Final Answer
Thus, the perimeter of one of the triangles, expressed in simplest radical form, is:

\[
\boxed{7 + 3.5\sqrt{2}}
\] 

This is the final answer, and it is expressed in a clear and mathematically rigorous manner.","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.0140877
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of counting the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships, we will break down the calculations step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the Setup
- There are **3 teams**.
- Each team has **4 players**.
- Each player shakes hands:
  - **Once** with each member of their own team (3 teammates).
  - **Three times** with each member of the opposing teams (8 opponents total, since there are 2 opposing teams with 4 players each).

### Step 2: Calculate Handshakes for One Player
1. **Handshakes with Own Team**:
   Each player shakes hands with their 3 teammates once:
   \[
   \text{Handshakes with own team} = 3 \text{ (1 handshake with each of the 3 teammates)} = 3
   \]

2. **Handshakes with Opposing Teams**:
   Each player shakes hands with each of the 8 opponents three times:
   \[
   \text{Handshakes with opposing teams} = 8 \text{ (opponents)} \times 3 \text{ (handshakes each)} = 24
   \]

3. **Total Handshakes per Player**:
   Adding both types of handshakes together:
   \[
   \text{Total handshakes per player} = 3 + 24 = 27
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Handshakes for All Players
- There are a total of \(3 \text{ teams} \times 4 \text{ players/team} = 12 \text{ players}\).
- Therefore, the total number of handshakes (before accounting for double counting) is:
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = 12 \text{ players} \times 27 \text{ handshakes/player} = 324
\]

### Step 4: Adjust for Double Counting
Since each handshake involves two players, we have counted each handshake twice. Thus, we need to divide the total by 2:
\[
\text{Final total handshakes} = \frac{324}{2} = 162
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of handshakes that occur during the championships is:
\[
\boxed{162}
\]","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).","To solve the problem of how many distinct values can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses, we need to analyze the expression and the possible ways to group the multiplications.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Understanding the Expression**:
   The original expression is:
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1
   \]
   The multiplication is performed first, followed by the addition of 1.

2. **Identifying the Operations**:
   The operations involved are:
   - Multiplication (denoted by \(\cdot\))
   - Addition (denoted by \(+\))

   In the original expression, we have three multiplication operations and one addition operation.

3. **Inserting Parentheses**:
   By inserting parentheses, we can change the order of operations for the multiplications. The goal is to find all distinct results from different groupings of the multiplications before adding 1.

4. **Possible Groupings**:
   We can group the numbers in various ways. Here are the possible groupings:
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5)\)
   - \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5\)
   - \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5))\)
   - \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)\)
   - And other combinations.

5. **Calculating Each Grouping**:
   We will calculate the result for each grouping:
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 6 \cdot 20 = 120\)
   - \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 = (2 \cdot 12) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 120\)
   - \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) = 2 \cdot (3 \cdot 20) = 2 \cdot 60 = 120\)
   - \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 20 = 120\)

   All these groupings yield the same result of 120.

6. **Adding 1**:
   After calculating all distinct multiplication results, we add 1 to each:
   \[
   120 + 1 = 121
   \]

7. **Conclusion**:
   Since all groupings lead to the same multiplication result of 120, the only distinct value we can obtain from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) is 121.

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of distinct values that can be obtained from the expression by inserting parentheses is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.

   - Eyebrows: 2 options
   - Eyes: 1 option
   - Ears: 2 options
   - Lips: 2 options
   - Shoes: 2 options

3. **Combine the Options**:
   The total number of different personalities can be calculated by multiplying the number of options for each feature together:
   \[
   \text{Total Personalities} = (\text{Hairstyles}) \times (\text{Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Eyes}) \times (\text{Ears}) \times (\text{Lips}) \times (\text{Shoes})
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Total Personalities} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - First, calculate \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
   - Then, \(8 \times 1 = 8\)
   - Next, \(8 \times 2 = 16\)
   - Then, \(16 \times 2 = 32\)
   - Finally, \(32 \times 2 = 64\)

Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities that Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head is:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 64
\]

### Final Answer
The final answer, formatted in LaTeX notation, is:

\[
\boxed{64}
\]","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.010814550000000001
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To solve the problem of finding how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one '0', we can break down the solution step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define the Range
We are interested in whole numbers between 100 and 999 (inclusive). This is because:
- The range starts from 100 (the smallest three-digit number).
- The range ends at 999 (the largest three-digit number).

### Step 2: Identify the Structure of the Numbers
A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
- \(a\) is the hundreds digit (can be from 1 to 9),
- \(b\) is the tens digit (can be from 0 to 9),
- \(c\) is the units digit (can be from 0 to 9).

### Step 3: Conditions for Exactly One '0'
To have exactly one '0' in the number \(abc\), we can have the following cases:
1. \(a = 0\) (not possible since \(a\) must be from 1 to 9).
2. \(b = 0\) and \(c \neq 0\).
3. \(c = 0\) and \(b \neq 0\).

### Step 4: Count Valid Combinations
#### Case 1: \(b = 0\)
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- Total for this case: \(9 \times 9 = 81\).

#### Case 2: \(c = 0\)
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(b\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- Total for this case: \(9 \times 9 = 81\).

### Step 5: Combine the Results
Now, we add the results from both cases:
\[
\text{Total} = 81 + 81 = 162
\]

### Conclusion
Thus, the total number of whole numbers between 100 and 999 that contain exactly one '0' is:

\[
\boxed{162}
\] 

This confirms the output of the provided code, which correctly counts the numbers with exactly one '0' in the specified range.","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.0099681
