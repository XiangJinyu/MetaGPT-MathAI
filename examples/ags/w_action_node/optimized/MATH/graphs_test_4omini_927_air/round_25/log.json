        "model_output": "The simplified solution is incorrect. Let's analyze the expression \\(2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 + 1\\) and the possible ways to insert parentheses.\n\n1. The original expression evaluates to \\(2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\\).\n2. By inserting parentheses, we can create different groupings. The possible distinct values obtained by inserting parentheses are:\n   - \\( (2 \\cdot 3) \\cdot (4 \\cdot 5) + 1 = 6 \\cdot 20 + 1 = 121\\)\n   - \\( 2 \\cdot (3 \\cdot (4 \\cdot 5)) + 1 = 2 \\cdot 60 + 1 = 121\\)\n   - \\( (2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4) \\cdot 5 + 1 = 24 \\cdot 5 + 1 = 121\\)\n   - \\( 2 \\cdot (3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5) + 1 = 2 \\cdot 60 + 1 = 121\\)\n   - \\( (2 \\cdot 3) \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 + 1 = 6 \\cdot 20 + 1 = 121\\)\n   - \\( 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot (4 \\cdot 5) + 1 = 2 \\cdot 60 + 1 = 121\\)\n\nHowever, we can also consider:\n- \\( (2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4) \\cdot (5 + 1) = 24 \\cdot 6 = 144\\)\n- \\( (2 \\cdot (3 \\cdot 4)) \\cdot (5 + 1) = 24 \\cdot 6 = 144\\)\n- \\( (2 \\cdot 3) \\cdot (4 \\cdot (5 + 1)) = 6 \\cdot 24 = 144\\)\n- \\( 2 \\cdot (3 \\cdot (4 \\cdot (5 + 1))) = 2 \\cdot 60 = 120\\)\n\nThus, the distinct values obtained are 121 and 144.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct values that can be obtained is 2.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",
