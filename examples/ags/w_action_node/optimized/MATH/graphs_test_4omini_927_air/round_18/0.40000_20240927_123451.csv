"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We have a convex pentagon with two congruent acute angles and three other angles, each equal to the sum of the two acute angles. We need to find the measure of the large angles.

### Step 2: Break Down the Problem
Let:
- \( x \) be the measure of each of the two congruent acute angles.
- The measure of each of the three larger angles will then be \( 2x \) (since each large angle is equal to the sum of the two acute angles).

### Step 3: Identify Key Information
1. The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)):
   \[
   \text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
   \]

2. The angles in the pentagon can be expressed as:
   - Two angles of \( x \)
   - Three angles of \( 2x \)

### Step 4: Set Up the Equation
The total sum of the angles can be expressed as:
\[
2x + 3(2x) = 540^\circ
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 6x = 540^\circ
\]
\[
8x = 540^\circ
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
Now, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
\]

### Step 6: Find the Measure of the Large Angles
The measure of each of the large angles is:
\[
2x = 2 \times 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ
\]

### Step 7: Final Answer
Thus, the common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is:
\[
\boxed{135^\circ}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",0,0.008146949999999998

[/asy]","To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \( n \) in the given magic square. A magic square is defined such that the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are equal.

### Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Magic Square

The magic square is structured as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 2: Identify the Key Information

We need to find the common sum \( S \) of each row, column, and diagonal. We will set up equations based on the sums of the rows.

### Step 3: Set Up the Equations

1. **First Row:**
   \[
   (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 2n + 1
   \]

2. **Second Row:**
   \[
   3 + (2n-9) + n = 3n - 6
   \]

3. **Third Row:**
   \[
   (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = 2n + 1
   \]

### Step 4: Set the Sums Equal

Since all rows must sum to the same value, we can set the sums of the first and second rows equal to each other:

\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( n \)

Rearranging the equation:

\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \implies 1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n
\]

### Step 6: Verify the Solution

Now we will substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square to verify that all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to the same value.

1. **First Row:**
   \[
   (7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
   \]

2. **Second Row:**
   \[
   3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
   \]

3. **Third Row:**
   \[
   (7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15

4. **First Column:**
   \[

   \]

5. **Second Column:**
   \[
   (7+2) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 1 = 9 + 5 + 1 = 15
   \]

6. **Third Column:**
   \[
   2 + 7 + (7-1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15

7. **Main Diagonal:**
   \[
   (7-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15

8. **Other Diagonal:**
   \[
   2 + (2n-9) + (7+1) = 2 + 5 + 8 = 15

### Final Answer

Since all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to 15, the value of \( n \) is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to determine how many bad workers are required to help 3 good workers paint a house in 3 hours.

### Step 2: Break Down the Problem
1. Calculate the work rate of good workers.
2. Calculate the work rate of bad workers.
3. Determine the total work needed to paint the house.
4. Set up an equation to find the number of bad workers needed.

### Step 3: Identify Key Information
- Each good worker can paint the house in 12 hours.
- Each bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours.
- We need the house painted in 3 hours.
- We have 3 good workers.

### Step 4: Apply Mathematical Concepts
1. **Work Rate of Good Workers**:
   - A good worker's rate is \( \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour} \).
   - For 3 good workers: 
     \[
     \text{Rate of 3 good workers} = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

2. **Work Rate of Bad Workers**:
   - A bad worker's rate is \( \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour} \).
   - Let \( b \) be the number of bad workers. The rate of \( b \) bad workers is:
     \[
     \text{Rate of } b \text{ bad workers} = b \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{b}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

3. **Total Work Needed**:
   - The total work needed to paint the house is 1 house.

4. **Total Rate Needed**:
   - To finish in 3 hours, the combined rate of good and bad workers must be:
     \[
     \text{Total rate} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{3 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

### Step 5: Set Up the Equation
Combining the rates of good and bad workers:
\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{b}{36} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

### Step 6: Solve the Equation
1. To eliminate the fractions, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4, 36, and 3 is 108.
2. Multiply the entire equation by 108:
   \[
   108 \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) + 108 \left(\frac{b}{36}\right) = 108 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   27 + 3b = 36
   \]

3. Solve for \( b \):
   \[
   3b = 36 - 27
   \]
   \[
   3b = 9
   \]
   \[
   b = 3
   \]

### Step 7: Final Answer
You need to find **3 bad workers** in addition to the 3 good workers to paint the house in 3 hours.","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",0,0.013850249999999996
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To find a common English word with a product value of 715, we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to find a word such that the product of the values of its letters equals 715. Each letter corresponds to its position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26).

### Step 2: Factor the Number
First, we will factor 715 to find possible combinations of letter values.

### Step 3: Factorization of 715
To factor 715, we can start by checking for divisibility by small prime numbers:

- **Divisibility by 5**: Since 715 ends in 5, it is divisible by 5.
  \[
  715 \div 5 = 143
  \]

- **Next, factor 143**: Check for divisibility by 11 (the next prime number).
  \[
  143 \div 11 = 13
  \]
  
Thus, we have:
\[
715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
\]

### Step 4: Corresponding Letter Values
Now we will convert these factors into their corresponding letter values:
- 5 corresponds to E
- 11 corresponds to K
- 13 corresponds to M

### Step 5: Forming the Word
The letters E, K, and M can be arranged to form the word ""MEK"" or ""KEM"", but these are not common English words. 

### Step 6: Check for Other Combinations
Since we have the prime factorization, we can also consider combinations of these factors with other letters. 

- The letter values can be combined in different ways. For example, we can also consider:
  - 1 (A) can be multiplied with any of the factors without changing the product.
  
### Step 7: Finding a Common Word
We can try to find a common word that includes these letters or their combinations. 

After checking various combinations, we find that:
- The word ""ME"" (M=13, E=5) gives us \( 13 \times 5 = 65 \), which is not sufficient.
- The word ""KEM"" does not yield a common word.

### Step 8: Final Check
After checking various combinations and common words, we find that the word ""SKIM"" (S=19, K=11, I=9, M=13) gives us:
\[
19 \times 11 \times 9 \times 13 = 715
\]

### Final Answer
The common English word with a product value of 715 is **SKIM**.","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}
(5)\cdot (11) \cdot (13) &= 5\cdot 11\cdot 13 \\
(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.",0,0.011493899999999994

15^2 = 15 \times 15 = 225
\]

### Step 3: Estimate the original number's square
Now, we need to check how close \( 14.7923412^2 \) is to \( 15^2 \). We can calculate \( 14.7923412^2 \) directly for comparison, but since we are estimating, we can also consider the effect of the rounding.

### Step 4: Calculate \( 14.7923412^2 \) for verification

\[
\boxed{200}
\]","We know $14^2=196$ and $15^2=225.$ So both $14^2$ and $15^2,$ estimated to the nearest hundred, are 200. Therefore, the square of any number between 14 and 15 will also be $\boxed{200},$ when rounded to the nearest hundred.",1,0.004302449999999999
"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We have a square piece of paper with an area of \(49\) square inches. When folded, one pair of opposite corners coincide, creating two congruent triangles upon unfolding. We need to find the perimeter of one of these triangles.

2. **Breaking Down the Problem**: 
   - First, we need to determine the side length of the square.
   - Next, we will analyze the triangles formed by the fold.

3. **Identifying Key Information**:
   - The area of the square is given as \(49\) square inches.
   - The area of a square is calculated as \(s^2\), where \(s\) is the side length.

4. **Calculating the Side Length of the Square**:
   \[
   s^2 = 49 \implies s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Analyzing the Fold**:
   - When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, the fold creates a diagonal line from one corner to the opposite corner.
   - The length of the diagonal \(d\) of the square can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   d = s\sqrt{2} = 7\sqrt{2} \text{ inches}
   \]

6. **Finding the Triangles**:
   - The fold creates two congruent right triangles. Each triangle has:
     - One leg equal to half the side length of the square, which is:
     \[
     \frac{s}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \text{ inches}
     \]
     - The other leg is also equal to half the side length of the square, which is the same:
     \[
     \frac{s}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \text{ inches}
     \]
     - The hypotenuse of each triangle is the diagonal of the square, which we calculated as \(7\sqrt{2}\) inches.

7. **Calculating the Perimeter of One Triangle**:
   - The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides:
   \[
   P = \text{leg}_1 + \text{leg}_2 + \text{hypotenuse}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P = \frac{7}{2} + \frac{7}{2} + 7\sqrt{2}

   Simplifying:
   \[
   P = 7 + 7\sqrt{2}
   \]

8. **Final Answer**:
   The perimeter of one of the triangles is:
   \[
   \boxed{7 + 7\sqrt{2}} \text{ inches}

Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.011158799999999995
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of how many handshakes occur at the national curling championships, we will follow the steps outlined.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We have three teams, each consisting of four players. Each player shakes hands three times with every member of the opposing teams and once with each member of their own team.

### Step 2: Break Down the Problem
1. **Identify the number of players**: There are 3 teams with 4 players each, so the total number of players is:
   \[
   3 \text{ teams} \times 4 \text{ players/team} = 12 \text{ players}
   \]

2. **Handshakes with own team**: Each player shakes hands once with each of their own team members.

3. **Handshakes with opposing teams**: Each player shakes hands three times with each member of the opposing teams.

### Step 3: Identify Key Information
- Each team has 4 players.
- Each player shakes hands with 3 members of each of the other 2 teams (3 handshakes per player per opponent).
- Each player shakes hands once with each of their own 3 teammates.

### Step 4: Apply Mathematical Concepts
1. **Handshakes within the same team**:
   - Each player shakes hands with 3 teammates.
   - For 4 players in a team, the total handshakes within the team can be calculated using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \) where \( n \) is the number of players in the team:
   \[
   \text{Handshakes within one team} = \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
   \]
   Since there are 3 teams, the total handshakes within all teams is:
   \[
   3 \text{ teams} \times 6 \text{ handshakes/team} = 18 \text{ handshakes}
   \]

2. **Handshakes with opposing teams**:
   - Each player shakes hands with 8 players from the other two teams (4 players from each of the 2 opposing teams).
   - Each handshake occurs 3 times, so the total handshakes per player with opposing teams is:
   \[
   8 \text{ opposing players} \times 3 \text{ handshakes/player} = 24 \text{ handshakes/player}
   \]
   For all 12 players, the total handshakes with opposing teams is:
   \[
   12 \text{ players} \times 24 \text{ handshakes/player} = 288 \text{ handshakes}
   \]

### Step 5: Combine the Results
Now, we add the handshakes within teams and the handshakes with opposing teams:
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = \text{Handshakes within teams} + \text{Handshakes with opposing teams}
\]
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = 18 + 288 = 306
\]

### Step 6: Double-Check Calculations
- Handshakes within teams: 18 (correct)
- Handshakes with opposing teams: 288 (correct)
- Total: 306 (correct)

"The expression $2\cdot 3 \cdot 4\cdot 5+1$ is equal to 121, since multiplication is carried out before addition. However, we can obtain values other than 121 for this expression if we are allowed to change it by inserting parentheses. For example, we can obtain 144 by writing \[
(2\cdot (3\cdot 4)) \cdot (5+1) = 144.
\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).","To solve the problem, we need to explore how inserting parentheses in the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) can yield different results. The key is to understand how parentheses affect the order of operations, particularly the multiplication and addition.

### Step 1: Understand the Expression
The original expression is:
\[
2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1
\]
Calculating the multiplication first gives:
\[
2 \cdot 3 = 6
\]
\[
6 \cdot 4 = 24
\]
\[
24 \cdot 5 = 120
\]
Thus, the expression evaluates to:
\[
120 + 1 = 121
\]

### Step 2: Inserting Parentheses
We can insert parentheses in various ways to change the order of operations. The multiplication can be grouped in different ways, and we can also consider the addition of 1 at different stages.

### Step 3: Possible Groupings
We can group the multiplication in the following ways:

1. \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5)\)
2. \((2 \cdot 4) \cdot (3 \cdot 5)\)
3. \((2 \cdot 5) \cdot (3 \cdot 4)\)
4. \((3 \cdot 4) \cdot (2 \cdot 5)\)
5. \((3 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 4)\)
6. \((4 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 3)\)

Additionally, we can also consider adding 1 to different parts of the multiplication:

1. \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1\)
2. \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1)\)
3. \((2 \cdot 4) \cdot (3 \cdot 5 + 1)\)
4. \((2 \cdot 5) \cdot (3 \cdot 4 + 1)\)
5. \((3 \cdot 4) \cdot (2 \cdot 5 + 1)\)
6. \((3 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 4 + 1)\)
7. \((4 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 3 + 1)\)

### Step 4: Calculate Each Grouping
Now we will calculate the results for each grouping:

1. \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 6 \cdot 20 = 120\)
2. \((2 \cdot 4) \cdot (3 \cdot 5) = 8 \cdot 15 = 120\)
3. \((2 \cdot 5) \cdot (3 \cdot 4) = 10 \cdot 12 = 120\)
4. \((3 \cdot 4) \cdot (2 \cdot 5) = 12 \cdot 10 = 120\)
5. \((3 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 4) = 15 \cdot 8 = 120\)
6. \((4 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 3) = 20 \cdot 6 = 120\)

Now, adding 1 to different parts:
1. \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)
2. \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) = 6 \cdot 21 = 126\)
3. \((2 \cdot 4) \cdot (3 \cdot 5 + 1) = 8 \cdot 16 = 128\)
4. \((2 \cdot 5) \cdot (3 \cdot 4 + 1) = 10 \cdot 13 = 130\)
5. \((3 \cdot 4) \cdot (2 \cdot 5 + 1) = 12 \cdot 11 = 132\)
6. \((3 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 4 + 1) = 15 \cdot 9 = 135\)
7. \((4 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 3 + 1) = 20 \cdot 7 = 140\)

### Step 5: Collect Unique Results
The unique results we have calculated are:
- 120
- 121
- 126
- 128
- 130
- 132
- 135
- 140

### Step 6: Count Unique Values
Counting these unique values gives us a total of 8 distinct results.

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of different values that can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.
\end{align*}In total there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for the expression.",0,0.016557149999999996
"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To solve the problem of how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we will break down the components and calculate the total combinations step-by-step.

### Step 1: Identify the Components
The components of the Mr. Potato Head personality are:
- **Hairstyles**: 3 options (including the option to be bald)
- **Eyebrows**: 2 sets
- **Eyes**: 1 pair (googly eyes)
- **Ears**: 2 sets
- **Lips**: 2 sets
- **Shoes**: 2 options (regular shoes and clown shoes)

### Step 2: Determine the Options for Each Component
1. **Hairstyles**: 
   - 3 hairstyles + 1 option for being bald = 4 options
2. **Eyebrows**: 
   - 2 sets = 2 options
3. **Eyes**: 
   - 1 pair = 1 option
4. **Ears**: 
   - 2 sets = 2 options
5. **Lips**: 
   - 2 sets = 2 options
6. **Shoes**: 
   - 2 options = 2 options

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Combinations
To find the total number of different personalities, we multiply the number of options for each component together:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = (\text{Hairstyles}) \times (\text{Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Eyes}) \times (\text{Ears}) \times (\text{Lips}) \times (\text{Shoes})
\]

Substituting the values we found:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

### Step 4: Perform the Calculation
Now, we will calculate this step-by-step:

1. Calculate \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. Calculate \(8 \times 1 = 8\)
3. Calculate \(8 \times 2 = 16\)
4. Calculate \(16 \times 2 = 32\)
5. Calculate \(32 \times 2 = 64\)

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities that Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head is:

\[
\boxed{64}
\]","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.010002899999999997
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To find how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0, we can break down the problem as follows:

### Step 1: Define the Range
The numbers we are considering are three-digit numbers, specifically from 100 to 999.

### Step 2: Identify the Structure of the Numbers
A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
- \(a\) is the hundreds digit (can be from 1 to 9),
- \(b\) is the tens digit (can be from 0 to 9),
- \(c\) is the units digit (can be from 0 to 9).

### Step 3: Conditions for Exactly One 0
We need to find cases where exactly one of the digits \(a\), \(b\), or \(c\) is 0. 

#### Case 1: \(b = 0\)
- Here, the number takes the form \(a0c\).
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be 0, 9 options).
- Total for this case: \(9 \times 9 = 81\).

#### Case 2: \(c = 0\)
- Here, the number takes the form \(ab0\).
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(b\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be 0, 9 options).
- Total for this case: \(9 \times 9 = 81\).

### Step 4: Combine the Cases
Now, we add the totals from both cases:
\[
81 \text{ (from Case 1)} + 81 \text{ (from Case 2)} = 162.
\]

### Step 5: Final Answer
Thus, the total number of whole numbers between 99 and 999 that contain exactly one 0 is:
\[
\boxed{162}.
\]","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.009698099999999998
