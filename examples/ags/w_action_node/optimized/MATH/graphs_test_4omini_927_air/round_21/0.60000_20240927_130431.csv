"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","The refined solution provided is accurate and follows a logical approach to solving the problem regarding the angles of a convex pentagon. Let's review the steps to confirm their correctness:

1. **Sum of Interior Angles**: The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is correctly applied:
   \[
   \text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ = (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
   \]

2. **Setting Up the Equations**: The angles are defined as follows:
   - Let \( a \) be the measure of each of the two congruent acute angles.
   - Let \( b \) be the measure of each of the three larger angles.

   The equations derived from the problem statement are:
   \[
   2a + 3b = 540^\circ
   \]
   \[
   b = 2a
   \]

3. **Substituting and Solving**: Substituting \( b = 2a \) into the first equation:
   \[
   2a + 3(2a) = 540^\circ
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   2a + 6a = 540^\circ \implies 8a = 540^\circ \implies a = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
   \]

4. **Finding the Larger Angles**: Using the value of \( a \) to find \( b \):
   \[
   b = 2a = 2 \times 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: The common measure of the large angles is correctly stated as:
   \[
   \boxed{135}
   \]

All calculations are mathematically correct, the solution directly addresses the problem statement, and the units of measurement are consistent. The assumptions made (that the angles are acute and that the relationships between the angles hold) are valid.

Thus, the solution is confirmed to be accurate, and the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.01725855

[/asy]","The refined solution provided is accurate and correctly addresses the problem statement regarding the magic square. Let's confirm the calculations and the logic step-by-step.

### Step 1: Set up the magic square

The magic square is represented as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the magic constant

The magic constant \( S \) is the same for all rows, columns, and diagonals.

### Step 3: Calculate the sum of all numbers in the square

The sum of all the numbers in the square is:

\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 + 3 + (2n-9) + n + (n+1) + 1 + (n-1)
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
= n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2n - 9 + n + 1 + n - 1
\]
\[
= (n + n + 2n) + (-3 + 2 + 2 + 3 - 9 + 1 - 1)
\]
\[
= 4n + (-6)
\]
\[
= 4n - 6
\]

### Step 4: Set up equations for rows, columns, and diagonals

1. **First row**: 
   \[
   (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
   \]

2. **Second row**: 
   \[
   3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
   \]

3. **Third row**: 
   \[
   (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

### Step 5: Set the rows equal to each other

From the first and second rows, we have:

\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
1 + 6 = 3n - 2n
\]
\[
7 = n
\]

### Step 6: Verify the solution

Substituting \( n = 7 \):

- First row: 
  \[
  7 - 3 = 4, \quad 7 + 2 = 9, \quad 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
  \]

- Second row: 
  \[
  3, \quad 2(7) - 9 = 5, \quad 7 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
  \]

- Third row: 
  \[
  7 + 1 = 8, \quad 1, \quad 7 - 1 = 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
  \]

All rows sum to 15. Now check the columns:

- First column: 
  \[
  4 + 3 + 8 = 15
  \]

- Second column: 
  \[
  9 + 5 + 1 = 15
  \]

- Third column: 
  \[
  2 + 7 + 6 = 15
  \]

Finally, check the diagonals:

- Main diagonal: 
  \[
  4 + 5 + 6 = 15
  \]

- Other diagonal: 
  \[
  2 + 5 + 8 = 15
  \]

### Conclusion

Since all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to the same value, we confirm that the value of \( n \) is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\] 

The solution is accurate, and all calculations are correct.","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","The refined solution provided is accurate and correctly addresses the problem statement. Let's confirm the calculations step-by-step to ensure everything is correct.

### Step 1: Define the Work Rates

1. **Good Worker**: A good worker can paint the house in 12 hours. Therefore, the work done by one good worker in one hour is:
   \[
   \text{Work rate of good worker} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ of the house per hour}
   \]

2. **Bad Worker**: A bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours. Therefore, the work done by one bad worker in one hour is:
   \[
   \text{Work rate of bad worker} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ of the house per hour}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Work Done by Good Workers

With 3 good workers, the total work done by these good workers in 3 hours is:
\[
\text{Total work by good workers} = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} \times 3 = \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ of the house}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Remaining Work

The total work needed to paint the house is 1 (the whole house). The remaining work that needs to be done by bad workers is:
\[
\text{Remaining work} = 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the house}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Number of Bad Workers Needed

Let \( x \) be the number of bad workers needed. The equation for the remaining work done by bad workers in the available time is:
\[
x \times \text{Work rate of bad worker} \times \text{Total time available} = \text{Remaining work}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
x \times \frac{1}{36} \times 3 = \frac{1}{4}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x \times \frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{4}
\]
\[
x \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
\]
Now, solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{1/4}{1/12} = \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{12}{1} = 3
\]

### Step 5: Conclusion

Thus, the number of bad workers needed to complete the painting of the house in 3 hours is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]

This confirms that the original solution is correct, and the final answer is indeed \( \boxed{3} \). All calculations are mathematically correct, and the units of measurement are consistent throughout the solution. The assumptions made regarding the work rates of the workers are valid.","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.0195141
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","The refined solution contains a logical error in the conclusion. While the calculations regarding the prime factorization and the mapping of letters to their corresponding values are correct, the word ""EKM"" is not a common English word. 

Let's go through the solution step-by-step to find a valid common English word with a product value of 715.

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
Each letter corresponds to a numerical value: A = 1, B = 2, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is calculated by multiplying the values of its letters.

### Step 2: Prime Factorization of 715
The prime factorization of 715 is:
\[
715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
\]

### Step 3: Mapping Prime Factors to Letters
- 5 corresponds to E (5th letter)
- 11 corresponds to K (11th letter)
- 13 corresponds to M (13th letter)

### Step 4: Forming the Word
The letters derived from the prime factors are E, K, and M. However, we need to check if there are any common English words that can be formed using these letters or their combinations.

### Step 5: Exploring Combinations
We can also consider combinations of letters that yield the same product value. 

1. **Using E (5)**:
   - If we include E, we can try combinations with other letters.
   
2. **Using K (11)**:
   - If we include K, we can try combinations with other letters.

3. **Using M (13)**:
   - If we include M, we can try combinations with other letters.

### Finding a Valid Word
After exploring various combinations, we find that the word ""ME"" (M = 13, E = 5) gives:
\[
\text{Product value of ME} = 13 \times 5 = 65 \quad \text{(not valid)}
\]

However, if we consider the word ""KEG"":
- K = 11
- E = 5
- G = 7

Calculating the product:
\[
\text{Product value of KEG} = 11 \times 5 \times 7 = 385 \quad \text{(not valid)}
\]

After further exploration, we find that the word ""MIX"" (M = 13, I = 9, X = 24) gives:
\[
\text{Product value of MIX} = 13 \times 9 \times 24 = 2808 \quad \text{(not valid)}
\]

### Conclusion
After checking various combinations, it appears that there is no common English word that has a product value of 715 based on the letters derived from the prime factorization. 

Thus, the final answer is that there is no common English word with a product value of 715. 

\[
\boxed{\text{No common English word found}}
\]","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}
(5)\cdot (11) \cdot (13) &= 5\cdot 11\cdot 13 \\
(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.",0,0.021220649999999997

1. **Calculate the square of the given value**:
   \[
   14.7923412^2
   \]

2. **Round the squared value to the nearest hundred**.

First, we compute the square of \( 14.7923412 \):

\[
14.7923412^2 = 14.7923412 \times 14.7923412
\]

Using a calculator or performing the multiplication, we find:

\[
14.7923412^2 \approx 219.999999
\]

### Step 2: Round to the Nearest Hundred

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","Let's review the refined solution step by step to ensure its accuracy.

### Step 1: Calculate the side length of the square
The area \(A\) of a square is given by the formula:
\[
A = s^2
\]
where \(s\) is the side length of the square. Given that the area is \(49\) square inches, we can find the side length:
\[
s^2 = 49 \implies s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]
This calculation is correct.

### Step 2: Determine the dimensions of the triangles
When the square is folded, the corners that coincide create two right triangles. The legs of each triangle are half the side length of the square. Therefore, the lengths of the legs of the triangle are:
\[
\text{leg} = \frac{s}{2} = \frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \text{ inches}
\]
This is also correct.

### Step 3: Calculate the hypotenuse of the triangle
Using the Pythagorean theorem, the hypotenuse \(h\) of the triangle can be calculated as follows:
\[
h = \sqrt{\text{leg}^2 + \text{leg}^2} = \sqrt{(3.5)^2 + (3.5)^2} = \sqrt{12.25 + 12.25} = \sqrt{24.5} = \sqrt{(3.5)^2 \cdot 2} = 3.5\sqrt{2}
\]
This calculation is also correct.

### Step 4: Calculate the perimeter of one triangle
The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides:
\[
P = \text{leg} + \text{leg} + h = 3.5 + 3.5 + 3.5\sqrt{2}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
P = 7 + 3.5\sqrt{2}
\]
This calculation is correct.

### Step 5: Final answer in simplest radical form
Thus, the perimeter of one of the triangles is:
\[
\boxed{7 + 3.5\sqrt{2}}
\]

### Conclusion
The refined solution is accurate, and all calculations are correct. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7 + 3.5\sqrt{2}}
\]","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.01850115
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","The refined solution provided is accurate and correctly addresses the problem statement. Let's confirm the calculations step-by-step to ensure there are no errors.

### Step 1: Understand the Setup
- There are **3 teams**.
- Each team has **4 players**.
- Each player shakes hands:
  - **Once** with each of their **3 teammates**.
  - **3 times** with each member of the **2 opposing teams** (which means they will shake hands with **8 opposing players**).

### Step 2: Calculate Handshakes for One Player
1. **Handshakes with Own Team**:
   Each player shakes hands with their **3 teammates**:
   \[
   \text{Handshakes with own team} = 3
   \]

2. **Handshakes with Opposing Teams**:
   Each player shakes hands **3 times** with each of the **8 opposing players**:
   \[
   \text{Handshakes with opposing teams} = 3 \times 8 = 24
   \]

3. **Total Handshakes per Player**:
   Adding both contributions:
   \[
   \text{Total handshakes per player} = 3 + 24 = 27
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Handshakes for All Players
- The total number of players is:
\[
\text{Total players} = 3 \text{ teams} \times 4 \text{ players/team} = 12 \text{ players}
\]

- The total number of handshakes in the tournament (before accounting for double counting) is:
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = \text{Total handshakes per player} \times \text{Total players} = 27 \times 12 = 324
\]

### Step 4: Adjust for Double Counting
Since each handshake is counted twice (once for each participant), we need to divide the total by 2:
\[
\text{Final total handshakes} = \frac{324}{2} = 162
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of handshakes that occur during the championships is:
\[
\boxed{162}
\] 

### Prime Factorization
The prime factorization of 162 is:
\[
162 = 2 \times 81 = 2 \times 3^4
\]
Thus, the prime factors of 162 are \(2\) and \(3\). 

In summary, the total number of handshakes is \( \boxed{162} \). 

The solution is confirmed to be accurate, with all calculations and logic correctly applied.","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

- \(121, 101, 91, 85, 71, 65, 55\)

Thus, the total number of distinct values is \(7\).

### Final Answer
The number of distinct values that can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]

The solution is accurate, and all calculations are correct.","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.
\end{align*}In total there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for the expression.",0,0.023313599999999997
"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","The refined solution provided is accurate and correctly addresses the problem statement. Let's confirm the calculations step-by-step to ensure everything is correct.

### Step 1: Identify the Components
Tom's Mr. Potato Head has the following features:
- **Hairstyles**: 3 options
- **Eyebrows**: 2 options
- **Eyes**: 1 option (googly eyes)
- **Ears**: 2 options
- **Lips**: 2 options
- **Shoes**: 2 options (1 pair of regular shoes + 1 pair of clown shoes)

### Step 2: Calculate Combinations Without Hair
Calculating the total combinations without considering hairstyles (bald option):

\[
\text{Combinations without hair} = \text{Eyebrows} \times \text{Eyes} \times \text{Ears} \times \text{Lips} \times \text{Shoes}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Combinations without hair} = 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. \(2 \times 1 = 2\)
2. \(2 \times 2 = 4\)
3. \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
4. \(8 \times 2 = 16\)

Thus, the total combinations without hair is:

\[
\text{Combinations without hair} = 16
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Combinations With Hair
Now, considering the combinations that include hairstyles (and the bald option):

\[
\text{Combinations with hair} = (\text{Hairstyles} + 1) \times \text{Combinations without hair}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Combinations with hair} = (3 + 1) \times 16 = 4 \times 16
\]

Calculating this:

\[
4 \times 16 = 64
\]

### Step 4: Total Combinations
Finally, we add the combinations without hair to the combinations with hair to get the total number of different personalities:

\[
\text{Total combinations} = \text{Combinations without hair} + \text{Combinations with hair}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total combinations} = 16 + 64 = 80
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of different wacky personalities that Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head is:

\[
\boxed{80}
\]

This solution is mathematically rigorous, and all calculations have been verified to be correct. The assumptions made (that Mr. Potato Head can be bald and that the components cannot be mixed and matched) are valid. The final answer is accurate.","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",0,0.0189957
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"The refined solution provided is accurate and correctly addresses the problem statement. Let's review the steps to confirm the calculations and logic:

### Step 1: Define the Range
The range of whole numbers considered is from 100 to 999, which includes all three-digit numbers.

### Step 2: Identify the Structure of Three-Digit Numbers
A three-digit number can indeed be represented as \(abc\), where:
- \(a\) (hundreds place) ranges from 1 to 9,
- \(b\) (tens place) ranges from 0 to 9,
- \(c\) (units place) ranges from 0 to 9.

### Step 3: Conditions for Exactly One '0'
The scenarios for having exactly one '0' are correctly identified:
1. \(b = 0\) (0 in the tens place)
2. \(c = 0\) (0 in the units place)

### Step 4: Count the Valid Combinations
#### Case 1: \(b = 0\)
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- Total for this case: \(9 \times 9 = 81\).

#### Case 2: \(c = 0\)
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(b\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- Total for this case: \(9 \times 9 = 81\).

### Step 5: Combine the Results
Adding the results from both cases:
\[
81 + 81 = 162
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of whole numbers between 100 and 999 that contain exactly one '0' is indeed \(162\).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{162}
\]

All calculations are mathematically correct, the solution directly addresses the problem statement, and the units of measurement are consistent. No assumptions were made that are invalid. The solution is confirmed to be accurate.","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.01807875
