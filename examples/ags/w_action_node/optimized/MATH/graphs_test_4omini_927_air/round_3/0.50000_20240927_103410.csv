"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem of finding the common measure of the large angles in the convex pentagon, we will follow a structured approach, ensuring clarity and correctness in each step.

### Step 1: Define the Angles
Letâ€™s denote the two congruent acute angles as \( x \). Since they are acute, we know:
\[
0 < x < 90
\]

According to the problem, the measure of each of the other three interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. Therefore, we can express the measures of the three other angles as:
\[
y = x + x = 2x
\]

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation for the Sum of Interior Angles
The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
\]
where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, \( n = 5 \):
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
\]

### Step 3: Write the Equation for the Angles
Now, we can express the total sum of the angles in our pentagon:
\[
2x + 3(2x) = 540^\circ
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 6x = 540^\circ
\]
Combining like terms gives:
\[
8x = 540^\circ
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
Now, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \( y \)
Next, we find \( y \):
\[
y = 2x = 2 \times 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ
\]

### Step 6: Verify the Angles
Now we have the measures of the angles in the pentagon:
- Two angles of \( 67.5^\circ \)
- Three angles of \( 135^\circ \)

### Step 7: Check Validity of Angles
We need to ensure that all angles are valid for a convex pentagon:
- \( 67.5^\circ \) is acute (valid)
- \( 135^\circ \) is obtuse (valid)

### Conclusion
Since all angles are valid and the conditions of the problem are satisfied, we conclude that the common measure of the large angles \( y \) is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\] 

This solution confirms the initial findings and provides a clear, step-by-step verification of the calculations and reasoning involved.","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.015796199999999996

label(""$n-1$"",(2.5,2.5));
[/asy]","To solve for \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sums of each row, column, and diagonal are equal. Let's denote the magic constant (the common sum) as \( S \).

The magic square is structured as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the sum of the first row

The first row is:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the sum of the second row

The second row is:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the sum of the third row

The third row is:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 4: Set the sums of the rows equal to each other

From the first and third rows, we have:
\[
2n + 1 = 2n + 1 \quad \text{(this is always true)}
\]

From the first and second rows, we set them equal:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( n \)

Rearranging the equation:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
1 = n - 6
\]
Add \( 6 \) to both sides:
\[
n = 7
\]

### Step 6: Verify the value of \( n \)

Now we will substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check if all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to the same value.

Substituting \( n = 7 \):
- First row: 
\[
7 - 3 = 4, \quad 7 + 2 = 9, \quad 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]
- Second row:
\[
3, \quad 2(7) - 9 = 14 - 9 = 5, \quad 7 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]
- Third row:
\[
7 + 1 = 8, \quad 1, \quad 7 - 1 = 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]

### Step 7: Check the columns

- First column:
\[
4 + 3 + 8 = 15
\]
- Second column:
\[
9 + 5 + 1 = 15
\]
- Third column:
\[
2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]

### Step 8: Check the diagonals

- Main diagonal:
\[
4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]
- Other diagonal:
\[
2 + 5 + 8 = 15
\]

Since all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to \( 15 \), we confirm that our solution is correct.

Thus, the value of \( n \) is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem of how many bad workers are needed alongside 3 good workers to paint the house in 3 hours, we will follow a detailed step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Determine the Work Rates of Good and Bad Workers

1. **Good Worker:**
   - A good worker can paint the house in 12 hours.
   - Therefore, the work rate of one good worker is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of one good worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

2. **Bad Worker:**
   - A bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours.
   - Therefore, the work rate of one bad worker is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of one bad worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Work Rate of the Good Workers

Since we have 3 good workers, their combined work rate is:
\[
\text{Total work rate of 3 good workers} = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses per hour}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the Total Work Needed to Paint the House

The total work needed to paint the house is 1 house.

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Work Rate Needed to Finish in 3 Hours

To finish painting the house in 3 hours, the total work rate required is:
\[
\text{Total work rate needed} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{3 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ houses per hour}
\]

### Step 5: Set Up the Equation for the Total Work Rate

Let \( x \) be the number of bad workers. The total work rate from the bad workers is:
\[
\text{Total work rate of } x \text{ bad workers} = x \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{x}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
\]

Now, we can set up the equation for the total work rate:
\[
\text{Total work rate of good workers} + \text{Total work rate of bad workers} = \text{Total work rate needed}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{x}{36} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

### Step 6: Solve for \( x \)

To solve the equation, we first find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4, 36, and 3 is 36. We will convert each term to have a denominator of 36:
\[
\frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{36}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{12}{36}
\]

Now, substituting these values into the equation gives:
\[
\frac{9}{36} + \frac{x}{36} = \frac{12}{36}
\]

Now, we can eliminate the denominators by multiplying through by 36:
\[
9 + x = 12
\]

Subtracting 9 from both sides:
\[
x = 12 - 9 = 3
\]

### Conclusion

You need **3 bad workers** in addition to the 3 good workers to paint the house in 3 hours. 

This solution confirms the initial solution and provides a clear, step-by-step breakdown of the calculations and reasoning involved.","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",0,0.01903545
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To find a common English word with a product value of 715, we will follow a systematic approach, starting with the prime factorization of 715 and then exploring combinations of letters that correspond to those factors.

### Step 1: Factor 715

We begin by finding the prime factorization of 715.

1. **Check divisibility by 5** (the last digit is 5):
   \[
   715 \div 5 = 143
   \]
   Thus, we have:
   \[
   715 = 5 \times 143
   \]

2. **Next, factor 143**. We can check divisibility by 11:
   - The sum of the digits of 143 is \(1 + 4 + 3 = 8\), which is not divisible by 11.
   - Check divisibility by 13:
   \[
   143 \div 11 = 13
   \]
   So, we have:
   \[
   143 = 11 \times 13
   \]

Putting it all together, we find:
\[
715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
\]

### Step 2: Relate Factors to Letter Values

Next, we relate these factors to the letter values:
- 5 corresponds to E
- 11 corresponds to K
- 13 corresponds to M

### Step 3: Form Possible Words

Now we can form words using the letters E, K, and M. The possible combinations of these letters can be:
- E
- K
- M
- EK
- EM
- KM
- EKM

### Step 4: Check for Common English Words

Now we check which of these combinations form common English words:
- E: Not a word.
- K: Not a word.
- M: Not a word.
- EK: Not a word.
- EM: Not a word.
- KM: Not a word.
- EKM: Not a word.

None of these combinations yield a common English word.

### Step 5: Consider Other Combinations

Since we only used the letters corresponding to the prime factors, we can also consider combinations of these letters with repetitions or different arrangements. 

### Step 6: Check Other Combinations

We can also check combinations of letters that might yield the same product value. 

For example, we can check:
- 7 (G)
- 10 (J)
- 2 (B)
- 1 (A)

We can try combinations of these letters to see if they yield 715.

### Step 7: Explore Other Letter Combinations

Letâ€™s explore combinations of letters that could yield the product of 715. 

1. **Check combinations of letters**:
   - 7 (G)
   - 5 (E)
   - 11 (K)
   - 13 (M)

We can try combinations of these letters:
- G (7)
- E (5)
- K (11)
- M (13)

### Step 8: Check for Valid Words

We can check combinations of these letters:
- G + E + K = 7 * 5 * 11 = 385 (not valid)
- G + E + M = 7 * 5 * 13 = 455 (not valid)
- E + K + M = 5 * 11 * 13 = 715 (valid)

### Conclusion

The common English word that has a product value of 715 is **""MEG""** (M=13, E=5, G=7). 

Thus, the final answer is:
- The word **""MEG""** has a product value of 715.","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}
(5)\cdot (11) \cdot (13) &= 5\cdot 11\cdot 13 \\
(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.",0,0.023080950000000003
Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"To estimate \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred, we can follow a systematic approach. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Round the Number
First, we need to round \( 14.7923412 \) to a simpler number. The nearest whole number to \( 14.7923412 \) is \( 15 \).

### Step 2: Square the Rounded Number
Next, we calculate the square of \( 15 \):
\[
15^2 = 15 \times 15 = 225
\]

### Step 3: Consider the Original Number
Now, let's consider how close \( 14.7923412 \) is to \( 15 \). We can also calculate \( 14.7923412^2 \) directly for a more accurate estimate, but since we are estimating, we will stick with the rounded number for now.

### Step 4: Determine the Nearest Hundred
The result \( 225 \) is in the range of hundreds. We need to find the nearest hundred:
- The nearest hundred below \( 225 \) is \( 200 \).
- The nearest hundred above \( 225 \) is \( 300 \).

To determine which hundred \( 225 \) is closer to, we calculate the differences:
- Distance to \( 200 \): \( 225 - 200 = 25 \)
- Distance to \( 300 \): \( 300 - 225 = 75 \)

Since \( 25 < 75 \), \( 225 \) is closer to \( 200 \).

### Step 5: Final Answer
Thus, the estimate of \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred is:
\[
\boxed{200}
\]

### Alternative Approach
To ensure accuracy, let's consider an alternative method by estimating the square using a binomial expansion.

### Step 1: Use Binomial Expansion
We can express \( 14.7923412 \) as \( 15 - 0.2076588 \). Using the binomial expansion:
\[
(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2
\]
where \( a = 15 \) and \( b = 0.2076588 \).

### Step 2: Calculate Each Term
1. Calculate \( a^2 \):
   \[
   15^2 = 225
   \]

2. Calculate \( 2ab \):
   \[
   2 \times 15 \times 0.2076588 \approx 6.229764
   \]

3. Calculate \( b^2 \):
   \[
   (0.2076588)^2 \approx 0.0437 \quad (\text{using a calculator for precision})
   \]

### Step 3: Combine the Terms
Now, substitute back into the expansion:
\[
14.7923412^2 \approx 225 - 6.229764 + 0.0437 \approx 218.813936
\]

### Step 4: Round to the Nearest Hundred
Now, we round \( 218.813936 \) to the nearest hundred:
- The nearest hundred below is \( 200 \).
- The nearest hundred above is \( 300 \).

Since \( 218.813936 \) is closer to \( 200 \) than \( 300 \), we conclude that the estimate remains:
\[
\boxed{200}
\]

This alternative method confirms our initial estimate, providing a more thorough understanding of the problem.","We know $14^2=196$ and $15^2=225.$ So both $14^2$ and $15^2,$ estimated to the nearest hundred, are 200. Therefore, the square of any number between 14 and 15 will also be $\boxed{200},$ when rounded to the nearest hundred.",1,0.022642500000000003
"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem of finding the perimeter of one of the triangles formed when a square piece of paper is folded, we will follow a detailed step-by-step approach, ensuring clarity and accuracy.

### Step 1: Determine the Side Length of the Square

The area of the square is given as \(49\) square inches. The formula for the area \(A\) of a square is:

\[
A = s^2
\]

where \(s\) is the side length of the square. Setting the area equal to \(49\):

\[
s^2 = 49
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:

\[
s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Understand the Folding Process

When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, we can visualize this as folding the square along the diagonal. The corners that coincide are the two opposite corners of the square.

### Step 3: Determine the Dimensions of the Triangles Formed

The fold creates two congruent right triangles. Each triangle has:

- One leg equal to the side length of the square, which is \(7\) inches.
- The other leg is also equal to the side length of the square, which is \(7\) inches.

### Step 4: Calculate the Hypotenuse of the Triangle

The hypotenuse \(h\) of each triangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
h = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
\]

where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the legs. Here, both legs are \(7\) inches:

\[
h = \sqrt{7^2 + 7^2} = \sqrt{49 + 49} = \sqrt{98} = \sqrt{49 \cdot 2} = 7\sqrt{2} \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Perimeter of One Triangle

The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides:

\[
P = a + b + h
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
P = 7 + 7 + 7\sqrt{2} = 14 + 7\sqrt{2} \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 6: Final Answer

The perimeter of one of the triangles formed by the fold is:

\[
\boxed{14 + 7\sqrt{2}} \text{ inches}
\]

This solution confirms the initial solution's correctness and provides a clear, step-by-step breakdown of the calculations involved.","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.014799749999999997
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of counting the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships, we will break it down into clear steps, ensuring we account for both the handshakes within teams and those between opposing teams.

### Step 1: Identify the Teams and Players
We have:
- 3 teams
- Each team has 4 players

Thus, the total number of players is:
\[
3 \text{ teams} \times 4 \text{ players/team} = 12 \text{ players}
\]

### Step 2: Handshakes Within the Same Team
Each player shakes hands once with every member of their own team. For a single team of 4 players, the number of unique handshakes can be calculated using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \), where \( n \) is the number of players in the team:
\[
\text{Handshakes within one team} = \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
\]
Since there are 3 teams, the total number of handshakes within all teams is:
\[
\text{Total handshakes within teams} = 3 \text{ teams} \times 6 \text{ handshakes/team} = 18
\]

### Step 3: Handshakes Between Opposing Teams
Each player shakes hands 3 times with every member of the opposing teams. Each player has 2 opposing teams, and each team has 4 players, so the total number of players in the opposing teams is:
\[
\text{Players in opposing teams} = 4 \text{ players/team} \times 2 \text{ opposing teams} = 8 \text{ players}
\]
Each player shakes hands 3 times with each of these 8 players, leading to:
\[
\text{Handshakes per player with opposing teams} = 3 \text{ handshakes/player} \times 8 \text{ opposing players} = 24 \text{ handshakes/player}
\]
Now, since there are 12 players in total, the total number of handshakes between opposing teams is:
\[
\text{Total handshakes between opposing teams} = 12 \text{ players} \times 24 \text{ handshakes/player} = 288
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Handshakes
Now, we can find the total number of handshakes by adding the handshakes within teams and the handshakes between opposing teams:
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = \text{Total handshakes within teams} + \text{Total handshakes between opposing teams}
\]
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = 18 + 288 = 306
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of handshakes that occur at the national curling championships is:
\[
\boxed{306}
\] 

This detailed breakdown confirms the accuracy of the initial solution while providing a clear step-by-step explanation of the calculations involved.","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

(Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).","To solve the problem of how many unique values can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses, we will systematically explore the different ways to group the multiplications and then add 1.

### Step 1: Understand the Expression

The expression can be represented as:
\[
E = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1
\]
We need to explore how inserting parentheses can change the order of operations, particularly focusing on the multiplication part.

### Step 2: Identify Possible Groupings

We can group the four numbers in various ways. The multiplication can be grouped in pairs or triplets. Here are the possible groupings:

1. **Pairwise Groupings:**
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5)\)
   - \((2 \cdot 4) \cdot (3 \cdot 5)\)
   - \((2 \cdot 5) \cdot (3 \cdot 4)\)
   - \((3 \cdot 4) \cdot (2 \cdot 5)\)
   - \((3 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 4)\)
   - \((4 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 3)\)

2. **Three and One Groupings:**
   - \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5) \cdot 4\)
   - \((2 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) \cdot 3\)
   - \((3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) \cdot 2\)

### Step 3: Calculate the Results for Each Grouping

Now, we will calculate the value of \(E\) for each grouping and then add 1.

1. **Grouping: \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5)\)**
   \[
   (2 \cdot 3) = 6, \quad (4 \cdot 5) = 20 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 6 \cdot 20 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

2. **Grouping: \((2 \cdot 4) \cdot (3 \cdot 5)\)**
   \[
   (2 \cdot 4) = 8, \quad (3 \cdot 5) = 15 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 8 \cdot 15 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

3. **Grouping: \((2 \cdot 5) \cdot (3 \cdot 4)\)**
   \[
   (2 \cdot 5) = 10, \quad (3 \cdot 4) = 12 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 10 \cdot 12 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

4. **Grouping: \((3 \cdot 4) \cdot (2 \cdot 5)\)**
   \[
   (3 \cdot 4) = 12, \quad (2 \cdot 5) = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 12 \cdot 10 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

5. **Grouping: \((3 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 4)\)**
   \[
   (3 \cdot 5) = 15, \quad (2 \cdot 4) = 8 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 15 \cdot 8 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

6. **Grouping: \((4 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 3)\)**
   \[
   (4 \cdot 5) = 20, \quad (2 \cdot 3) = 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 20 \cdot 6 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

7. **Grouping: \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5\)**
   \[
   (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) = 24 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 24 \cdot 5 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

8. **Grouping: \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5) \cdot 4\)**
   \[
   (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5) = 30 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 30 \cdot 4 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

9. **Grouping: \((2 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) \cdot 3\)**
   \[
   (2 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) = 40 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 40 \cdot 3 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

10. **Grouping: \((3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) \cdot 2\)**
    \[
    (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) = 60 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 60 \cdot 2 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 120 + 1 = 121
    \]

### Step 4: Identify Unique Results

From all the calculations above, we see that every grouping yields the same result of \(121\). 

### Conclusion

Since all possible groupings of the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) result in the same value of \(121\), the total number of unique values that can be obtained by inserting parentheses is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.
\end{align*}In total there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for the expression.",0,0.026013750000000002
"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To solve the problem of how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we will break down the components and their options step-by-step, ensuring clarity and thoroughness in our calculations.

### Components and Choices:
1. **Hairstyles**: 3 options (plus the option to be bald).
2. **Eyebrows**: 2 sets.
3. **Eyes**: 1 pair (googly eyes).
4. **Ears**: 2 sets.
5. **Lips**: 2 sets.
6. **Shoes**: 2 options (regular shoes and clown shoes).

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Hairstyles**: 
   - Tom has 3 hairstyles, and he can also choose to be bald. Therefore, the total options for hairstyles = 3 (hairstyles) + 1 (bald) = **4 options**.

2. **Eyebrows**: 
   - There are 2 sets of eyebrows, so he has **2 options**.

3. **Eyes**: 
   - There is only 1 pair of googly eyes, so he has **1 option**.

4. **Ears**: 
   - There are 2 sets of ears, so he has **2 options**.

5. **Lips**: 
   - There are 2 sets of lips, so he has **2 options**.

6. **Shoes**: 
   - There are 2 options for shoes (regular shoes and clown shoes), so he has **2 options**.

### Total Combinations:
To find the total number of different wacky personalities, we multiply the number of options for each component together:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = (\text{Hairstyles}) \times (\text{Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Eyes}) \times (\text{Ears}) \times (\text{Lips}) \times (\text{Shoes})
\]

Substituting in the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication step-by-step:

1. \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. \(8 \times 1 = 8\)
3. \(8 \times 2 = 16\)
4. \(16 \times 2 = 32\)
5. \(32 \times 2 = 64\)

Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities that Tom can come up with is:

\[
\boxed{64}
\]

### Conclusion:
By systematically analyzing each component and calculating the total combinations, we confirm that Tom can create **64 different wacky personalities** with his Mr. Potato Head. This methodical approach ensures that all options are accounted for, leading to an accurate solution.","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.01748385
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To solve the problem of how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0, we will analyze the three-digit numbers (from 100 to 999) since 99 is not a three-digit number. We will break down the problem into cases based on the position of the digit 0.

### Step 1: Identify the range of numbers
The numbers we are interested in are from 100 to 999.

### Step 2: Structure of three-digit numbers
A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
- \(a\) is the hundreds place (1 to 9),
- \(b\) is the tens place (0 to 9),
- \(c\) is the units place (0 to 9).

### Step 3: Conditions for exactly one 0
To have exactly one 0 in the number \(abc\), we can have the following cases:
1. \(b = 0\) and \(c \neq 0\)
2. \(c = 0\) and \(b \neq 0\)

#### Case 1: \(b = 0\) and \(c \neq 0\)
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(b\) is fixed as 0.
- \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \text{ (choices for } a\text{)} \times 1 \text{ (choice for } b\text{)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for } c\text{)} = 9 \times 1 \times 9 = 81.
\]

#### Case 2: \(c = 0\) and \(b \neq 0\)
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(b\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(c\) is fixed as 0.

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \text{ (choices for } a\text{)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for } b\text{)} \times 1 \text{ (choice for } c\text{)} = 9 \times 9 \times 1 = 81.
\]

### Step 4: Combine the results
Now, we add the results from both cases:
\[
81 \text{ (from Case 1)} + 81 \text{ (from Case 2)} = 162.
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of whole numbers between 100 and 999 that contain exactly one 0 is \( \boxed{162} \). 

This solution is thorough and accounts for all possible configurations of the digit 0 in the three-digit numbers, ensuring that we have accurately counted all valid cases.","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.012935699999999998
