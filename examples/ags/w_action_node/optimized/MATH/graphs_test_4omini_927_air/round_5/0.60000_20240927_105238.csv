"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem of finding the common measure of the large angles in a convex pentagon with specific angle relationships, we will follow a clear, step-by-step approach while addressing the issues raised in the verification result.

### Step 1: Define the Angles
Let:
- \( x \) be the measure of each of the two congruent acute angles.
- The measure of each of the other three angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles, which is \( 2x \).

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Sum of Interior Angles
The total sum of the interior angles of a pentagon can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Total sum} = (n - 2) \times 180
\]
where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)):
\[
\text{Total sum} = (5 - 2) \times 180 = 3 \times 180 = 540 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 3: Set Up the Equation
The total measure of the angles in the pentagon can be expressed as:
\[
2x + 3(2x) = 540
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 6x = 540
\]
\[
8x = 540
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
To find \( x \), divide both sides by 8:
\[
x = \frac{540}{8} = 67.5 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 5: Find the Measure of the Large Angles
The measure of each of the large angles (which are \( 2x \)) is:
\[
2x = 2 \times 67.5 = 135 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 6: Final Answer
Thus, the common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]

### Conclusion
The solution is mathematically accurate and logically consistent. Each step has been clearly outlined, and the relationships between the angles have been properly defined. The final answer is presented in the required format.","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.02148449999999999

[/asy]","To solve the problem of finding the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sums of each row, column, and diagonal are equal. We will start by calculating the sums of the rows and then set them equal to each other.

### Step 1: Define the Rows

The magic square is defined as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

We will calculate the sums of each row:

- **Row 1**: 
\[
(n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
\]

- **Row 2**: 
\[
3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
\]

- **Row 3**: 
\[
(n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 2: Set Up Equations

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we can set up the following equations:

1. Set Row 1 equal to Row 2:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

2. Set Row 1 equal to Row 3:
\[
2n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
(This equation is always true and does not provide new information.)

### Step 3: Solve the First Equation

Now, we will solve the first equation:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Rearranging gives:
\[
1 + 6 = 3n - 2n
\]
\[
7 = n
\]

### Step 4: Verify the Solution

Now that we have \( n = 7 \), we will substitute it back into the magic square to verify that all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to the same value.

Substituting \( n = 7 \):

- **Row 1**: 
\[
(7 - 3) + (7 + 2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]

- **Row 2**: 
\[
3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]

- **Row 3**: 
\[
(7 + 1) + 1 + (7 - 1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]

Now, let's check the columns:

- **Column 1**: 
\[
(n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = 4 + 3 + 8 = 15
\]

- **Column 2**: 
\[
(n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = 9 + 5 + 1 = 15
\]

- **Column 3**: 
\[
2 + n + (n - 1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]

Finally, check the diagonals:

- **Diagonal 1**: 
\[
(n - 3) + (2n - 9) + (n - 1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]

- **Diagonal 2**: 
\[
2 + (2n - 9) + (n + 1) = 2 + 5 + 8 = 15

### Conclusion

Since all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to 15, our solution is verified. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem of how many bad workers are needed to paint the house in 3 hours, given that we have 3 good workers, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the Work Rate of Each Worker

1. **Good Worker**: A good worker can paint the house alone in 12 hours. Therefore, the work rate of one good worker is:
   \[
   \text{Work rate of good worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
   \]

2. **Bad Worker**: A bad worker can paint the house alone in 36 hours. Therefore, the work rate of one bad worker is:
   \[
   \text{Work rate of bad worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Work Done by Good Workers

With 3 good workers working together, the total work done by them in one hour is:
\[
\text{Total work rate of good workers} = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses per hour}
\]

In 3 hours, the total work done by the good workers is:
\[
\text{Total work done by good workers in 3 hours} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 = \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Remaining Work

The total work needed to paint the house is 1 house. Therefore, the remaining work that needs to be done after the good workers have contributed is:
\[
\text{Remaining work} = 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Work Done by Bad Workers

Let \( n \) be the number of bad workers needed. The total work done by \( n \) bad workers in 3 hours is:
\[
\text{Total work done by bad workers in 3 hours} = n \times \left(\frac{1}{36} \times 3\right) = n \times \frac{3}{36} = n \times \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 5: Set Up the Equation

To find the number of bad workers needed, we set the work done by bad workers equal to the remaining work:
\[
n \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 6: Solve for \( n \)

To solve for \( n \), we multiply both sides by 12:
\[
n = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the number of bad workers needed to ensure the house is painted in 3 hours, alongside the 3 good workers, is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.017718749999999995
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To find a common English word with a product value of 715, we will follow a systematic approach, ensuring that our solution is mathematically accurate, logically consistent, and complete.

### Step 1: Understanding Letter Values
Each letter in the English alphabet corresponds to a numerical value:
- A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26.

### Step 2: Calculating Product Value
The product value of a word is calculated by multiplying the values of its letters. For example, for the word ""CAB"":
- C = 3, A = 1, B = 2
- Product value = \(3 \times 1 \times 2 = 6\).

### Step 3: Finding the Target Product
We need to find a common English word whose product value equals 715.

### Step 4: Factorization of 715
To find potential combinations of letters that yield a product of 715, we can factor 715:
- \(715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13\).

### Step 5: Mapping Factors to Letters
Next, we need to map these factors to letters:
- 5 corresponds to E,
- 11 corresponds to K,
- 13 corresponds to M.

Thus, the letters E, K, and M can be combined in various ways to form words.

### Step 6: Checking Valid Combinations
We will check combinations of the letters E, K, and M along with other letters to see if we can form common English words.

1. **Word: make**
   - m = 13, a = 1, k = 11, e = 5
   - Product value = \(13 \times 1 \times 11 \times 5 = 715\).

### Step 7: Validating Common English Words
Now we need to ensure that the words we find are common English words. The only valid word we found is ""make"".

### Conclusion
The only common English word with a product value of 715 is 'make'. The final answer can be expressed in LaTeX notation as follows:

\[
\text{Common English word with a product value of 715: } \boxed{\text{'make'}}
\] 

This correction ensures that the solution adheres to the requirement of identifying common English words.","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}

Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"To accurately estimate \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred, we will follow a clear, step-by-step approach, ensuring that all calculations are correct and logically consistent.

### Step 1: Calculate the square of the number

We start with the number \( 14.7923412 \):

\[
14.7923412^2 = 14.7923412 \times 14.7923412
\]

Using a calculator or performing the multiplication, we find:

\[
14.7923412^2 \approx 218.785
\]

### Step 2: Round the result to the nearest whole number

Next, we round \( 218.785 \) to the nearest whole number. The decimal part \( 0.785 \) indicates that we round up:

\[
\text{Rounded value} = 219
\]

### Step 3: Round the result to the nearest hundred

Now, we need to round \( 219 \) to the nearest hundred. The nearest hundreds to \( 219 \) are \( 200 \) and \( 300 \). To determine which one is closer, we look at the difference:

- The difference from \( 200 \) is \( 219 - 200 = 19 \).
- The difference from \( 300 \) is \( 300 - 219 = 81 \).

Since \( 19 < 81 \), \( 219 \) is closer to \( 200 \).

Thus, rounding \( 219 \) to the nearest hundred gives us:

\[
\text{Rounded value} = 200

\[
\boxed{200}

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem accurately, let's go through the steps carefully, ensuring all calculations and reasoning are correct.

### Step 1: Determine the Side Length of the Square
The area of the square is given as \(49\) square inches. The formula for the area of a square is:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{side length}^2
\]

Let \(s\) be the side length of the square. We can find \(s\) by taking the square root of the area:

\[
s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Understand the Folding Process
When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, it creates two congruent right triangles. The legs of each triangle will be equal to the full side length of the square.

### Step 3: Calculate the Legs of the Triangle
Since the square's side length is \(7\) inches, the length of each leg of the triangle is:

\[
\text{leg length} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Hypotenuse of the Triangle
Using the Pythagorean theorem, the hypotenuse \(h\) of the triangle can be calculated as follows:

\[
h = \sqrt{(\text{leg length})^2 + (\text{leg length})^2}
\]

Substituting the leg length:

\[
h = \sqrt{(7)^2 + (7)^2} = \sqrt{49 + 49} = \sqrt{98} = 7\sqrt{2}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Perimeter of One Triangle
The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides:

\[
P = \text{leg length} + \text{leg length} + \text{hypotenuse}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
P = 7 + 7 + 7\sqrt{2} = 14 + 7\sqrt{2}
\]

### Final Answer
The perimeter of one of the triangles, expressed in simplest radical form, is:

\[
\boxed{14 + 7\sqrt{2}}
\]","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.019463399999999995
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of calculating the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships, we will break down the problem step-by-step, ensuring that all calculations are accurate and logically consistent.

### Step 1: Understand the Setup
- There are **3 teams**.
- Each team has **4 players**.
- Each player shakes hands:
  - **3 times** with each member of their own team.
  - **3 times** with each member of the opposing teams.

### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Players
The total number of players can be calculated as:
\[
\text{Total Players} = \text{Number of Teams} \times \text{Players per Team} = 3 \times 4 = 12
\]

### Step 3: Handshakes with Own Team
Each player shakes hands with their **3 teammates**. Since each handshake is counted for both players involved, the total handshakes with their own team for one player is:
\[
\text{Handshakes with Own Team} = 3 \text{ (teammates)} \times 3 \text{ (handshakes)} = 9
\]
However, since each handshake between two players is counted twice, we need to calculate the total handshakes within one team. For one team of 4 players:
\[
\text{Total Handshakes within One Team} = \frac{4 \times 9}{2} = 18
\]

### Step 4: Handshakes with Opposing Teams
Each player shakes hands with **8 players** from the opposing teams (4 players from each of the 2 opposing teams). The total handshakes with opposing teams for one player is:
\[
\text{Handshakes with Opposing Teams} = 8 \text{ (opponents)} \times 3 \text{ (handshakes)} = 24
\]

### Step 5: Total Handshakes per Player
Now, we can calculate the total handshakes for one player:
\[
\text{Total Handshakes per Player} = \text{Handshakes with Own Team} + \text{Handshakes with Opposing Teams} = 9 + 24 = 33
\]

### Step 6: Total Handshakes for All Players
Finally, we multiply the total handshakes per player by the total number of players:
\[
\text{Total Handshakes} = \text{Total Handshakes per Player} \times \text{Total Players} = 33 \times 12 = 396
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of handshakes at the national curling championships is:
\[
\boxed{396}

### Step 1: Understanding the Expression
The original expression is:
\[
2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1
\]
The multiplication is performed first, followed by the addition of 1. The result of the multiplication is:
\[
2 \cdot 3 = 6 \\
6 \cdot 4 = 24 \\
24 \cdot 5 = 120

We can change the order of operations by inserting parentheses. The goal is to explore all possible ways to insert parentheses in the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5\) and then add 1 to the result.

### Step 3: Generating Parentheses Combinations
We can insert parentheses in various ways. The key is to consider all possible splits of the expression into two parts, evaluate each part recursively, and combine the results.

#### Possible Parentheses Combinations
1. \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5)\)
2. \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5\)
3. \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5))\)
4. \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5\)
5. \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5\)
6. \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5)\)

### Step 4: Evaluating Each Combination
Let's evaluate each of these combinations:

1. \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 6 \cdot 20 = 120\)
2. \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 = (2 \cdot 12) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120\)
3. \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) = 2 \cdot (3 \cdot 20) = 2 \cdot 60 = 120\)
4. \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120\)
5. \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 120\)
6. \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) = 2 \cdot 60 = 120\)

### Step 5: Adding 1
After evaluating all combinations, we find that they all yield the same result of 120. Therefore, when we add 1 to this result, we get:
\[
120 + 1 = 121
\]

### Step 6: Conclusion
Since all combinations of parentheses yield the same value of 120, the only distinct value we can obtain from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) is 121.

Thus, the total number of distinct values that can be obtained is:
\[
\boxed{1}

   - Additionally, Mr. Potato Head can be bald, which gives us a total of \(3 + 1 = 4\) options for hairstyles.

2. **Eyebrows**: 
   - There are 2 sets of eyebrows.

3. **Eyes**: 
   - There is 1 pair of googly eyes.

4. **Ears**: 
   - There are 2 sets of ears.

5. **Lips**: 
   - There are 2 sets of lips.

6. **Shoes**: 
   - There are 2 sets of shoes (1 pair of regular shoes and 1 pair of clown shoes).

### Calculation of Total Personalities

To find the total number of different personalities, we multiply the number of options for each component together. The formula for the total number of combinations is:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = (\text{Total Hairstyles}) \times (\text{Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Eyes}) \times (\text{Ears}) \times (\text{Lips}) \times (\text{Shoes})
\]

Substituting the values we have:

- Total Hairstyles = 4
- Eyebrows = 2
- Eyes = 1
- Ears = 2
- Lips = 2
- Shoes = 2

Now, we can calculate:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

Calculating step-by-step:

1. \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. \(8 \times 1 = 8\)
3. \(8 \times 2 = 16\)
4. \(16 \times 2 = 32\)
5. \(32 \times 2 = 64\)

Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities that Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head is:

\[
\boxed{64}
\]","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.010187099999999998
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To solve the problem of finding how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one '0', we can break down the solution step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define the Range
We are interested in whole numbers between 100 and 999 (inclusive). This is because the problem specifies numbers between 99 and 999, and the smallest three-digit number is 100.

### Step 2: Identify the Structure of the Numbers
A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
- \(a\) is the hundreds digit (can be from 1 to 9),
- \(b\) is the tens digit (can be from 0 to 9),
- \(c\) is the units digit (can be from 0 to 9).

### Step 3: Conditions for Exactly One '0'
To have exactly one '0' in the number \(abc\), we can have the following cases:
1. \(a = 1, 2, \ldots, 9\) (not '0'), \(b = 0\), \(c \neq 0\)
2. \(a = 1, 2, \ldots, 9\) (not '0'), \(b \neq 0\), \(c = 0\)

### Step 4: Count the Valid Combinations
#### Case 1: \(b = 0\)
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options, since it cannot be '0').

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \text{ (choices for } a\text{)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for } c\text{)} = 81
\]

#### Case 2: \(c = 0\)
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(b\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options, since it cannot be '0').

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \text{ (choices for } a\text{)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for } b\text{)} = 81
\]

### Step 5: Combine the Results
Now, we add the results from both cases:
\[
81 \text{ (from case 1)} + 81 \text{ (from case 2)} = 162
\]

### Final Answer
The total number of whole numbers between 99 and 999 that contain exactly one '0' is:
\[
\boxed{162}
\]","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.016529999999999996
