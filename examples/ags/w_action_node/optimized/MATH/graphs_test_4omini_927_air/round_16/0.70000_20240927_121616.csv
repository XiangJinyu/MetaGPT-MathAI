"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","Let's analyze the problem and the simplified solution step by step.

1. **Review the problem statement**: We have a convex pentagon with two congruent acute angles, and the other three angles are each equal to the sum of the two acute angles.

2. **Check for logical errors**: 
   - Let the measure of each acute angle be \( x \). Thus, the two acute angles contribute \( 2x \) to the total angle sum.
   - The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula \( (n-2) \times 180^\circ \), where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, \( n = 5 \), so the total is \( 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ \).
   - The three larger angles are each equal to \( 2x \), so we can express the total angle sum as:
     \[
     2x + 3(2x) = 540^\circ
     \]
     Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     2x + 6x = 540^\circ \implies 8x = 540^\circ \implies x = 67.5^\circ
     \]
   - The measure of each of the larger angles is \( 2x = 2(67.5^\circ) = 135^\circ \).

3. **Verify that the solution addresses all parts of the question**: The solution correctly identifies the measures of the angles and confirms that the larger angles are indeed \( 135^\circ \).

4. **Ensure that the answer is in the correct units and format**: The answer is in degrees, which is appropriate for angle measures.

5. **Final verification**: The calculations are correct, and the interpretation of the problem is accurate.

Since no errors were found, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{135}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.020798999999999995

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( n \) in a magic square where the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals are equal.

2. **Check for Errors**: 
   - The entries of the magic square are:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
     3 & 2n-9 & n \\
     n+1 & 1 & n-1

     \]
   - The sum of the second row is:
     \[
     3 + (2n-9) + n = 3n - 6

   - The sum of the third row is:
     \[
     (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = 2n + 1
     \]
   - Setting the sums of the first and second rows equal gives:

     Solving this:
     \[
     1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies n = 7

     - Other diagonal:
       \[
       2 + (2n-9) + (n+1) = 3n - 6

4. **Check Units and Format**: The answer is a numerical value, which is appropriate.

5. **Final Verification**: The calculations confirm that \( n = 7 \) satisfies the conditions of the magic square.

Since no errors were found in the calculations and the solution is consistent, the final answer is:

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","Let's analyze the problem and the simplified solution step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have good workers who can paint the house in 12 hours and bad workers who can do it in 36 hours. We need the house painted in 3 hours, and we have 3 good workers. We need to find out how many bad workers are required.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculations**:
   - The rate of work for a good worker is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of the house per hour.
   - The rate of work for a bad worker is \( \frac{1}{36} \) of the house per hour.
   - With 3 good workers, their combined rate is:
     \[
     3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the house per hour.}
     \]
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bad workers. Their combined rate is:
     \[
     x \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{x}{36} \text{ of the house per hour.}
     \]
   - The total rate of work from both good and bad workers must equal the rate needed to complete the house in 3 hours:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} + \frac{x}{36} = \frac{1}{3}.
     \]

3. **Solving the Equation**:
   - To solve for \( x \), we first find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 4, 36, and 3 is 36.
   - Rewriting the equation:
     \[
     \frac{9}{36} + \frac{x}{36} = \frac{12}{36}.
     \]
   - Combining the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{9 + x}{36} = \frac{12}{36}.
     \]
   - Cross-multiplying gives:
     \[
     9 + x = 12.
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 12 - 9 = 3.
     \]

4. **Final Verification**: The solution correctly calculates the number of bad workers needed. The answer is in the correct format and units.

5. **Final Answer**: The number of bad workers required is:
\[
\boxed{3}

Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.022593299999999993

What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","Let's analyze the problem and the simplified solution step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We need to find a common English word whose product value equals 715, where the product value is calculated by multiplying the numerical values assigned to each letter (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26).

2. **Simplified Solution Review**: The solution states that there is ""None"" as the answer.

3. **Logical Errors and Calculation Mistakes**: 
   - We need to factor 715 to see if it can be represented as a product of values corresponding to letters.
   - The prime factorization of 715 is \(5 \times 11 \times 13\).
   - The values 5, 11, and 13 correspond to the letters E, K, and M respectively.

4. **Verification of Solution**: 
   - The letters E (5), K (11), and M (13) can be combined to form the word ""EMK"" or any permutation of these letters. However, ""EMK"" is not a common English word.
   - We can also check other combinations of letters that multiply to 715, but the only valid letters corresponding to the factors are E, K, and M.

5. **Final Conclusion**: Since we found that the product value of 715 can be achieved with the letters E, K, and M, but they do not form a common English word, the original conclusion of ""None"" is correct.

Thus, the final answer remains:

\[
\boxed{\text{None}}
\]","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}
(5)\cdot (11) \cdot (13) &= 5\cdot 11\cdot 13 \\
(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\

Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","Let's analyze the problem and the simplified solution step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have a square piece of paper with an area of \(49\) square inches. The side length of the square is \(\sqrt{49} = 7\) inches. When folded, two opposite corners coincide, forming two congruent triangles.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculations**: 
   - When the square is folded, the diagonal of the square becomes the base of the triangles formed. The length of the diagonal \(d\) of the square can be calculated using the formula \(d = s\sqrt{2}\), where \(s\) is the side length. Thus, \(d = 7\sqrt{2}\).
   - The height of each triangle is half the side length of the square, which is \(\frac{7}{2}\).

3. **Area of the Triangle**: The area \(A\) of one triangle can be calculated as:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 7\sqrt{2} \times \frac{7}{2} = \frac{49\sqrt{2}}{4}
   \]
   This confirms the triangles are congruent.

4. **Perimeter Calculation**: The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle consists of the two legs and the base:
   - The legs are both equal to the side length of the square, which is \(7\) inches.
   - The base is the diagonal, which is \(7\sqrt{2}\).

   Therefore, the perimeter is:
   \[
   P = 7 + 7 + 7\sqrt{2} = 14 + 7\sqrt{2}
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: The simplified solution provided was \(7 + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}\), which is incorrect. The correct perimeter of one triangle is \(14 + 7\sqrt{2}\).

Thus, the corrected final answer is:
\[
\boxed{14 + 7\sqrt{2}}
\]","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.022918199999999993
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Problem Statement Review**: There are three teams of four players each. Each player shakes hands three times with every member of the opposing teams and once with each member of their own team.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculation Mistakes**:
   - Each team has 4 players, so there are a total of \(3 \times 4 = 12\) players.
   - Each player shakes hands with 3 members of each of the 2 opposing teams. Therefore, each player shakes hands with \(3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24\) players from opposing teams.
   - Each player also shakes hands once with the 3 members of their own team, adding 3 more handshakes.
   - Thus, each player has a total of \(24 + 3 = 27\) handshakes.

3. **Total Handshakes Calculation**:
   - Since there are 12 players, the total number of handshakes is \(12 \times 27 = 324\).
   - However, since each handshake involves two players, we must divide by 2 to avoid double counting. Thus, the total number of unique handshakes is \(\frac{324}{2} = 162\).

4. **Final Verification**: The solution correctly accounts for all handshakes and uses the given information properly. The answer is in the correct format.

5. **Final Answer**: No errors were found in the calculations or logic.

The final answer is \(\boxed{162}\).","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: The problem asks how many distinct values can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses, without rearranging the terms.

2. **Check for Errors**: The original expression evaluates to \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\). The solution states that only one value (121) can be obtained, which implies that no other arrangements of parentheses yield different results.

3. **Verification of Parentheses Insertion**: We need to explore different ways to insert parentheses:
   - \( (2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 6 \cdot 20 + 1 = 121 \)
   - \( 2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) + 1 = 2 \cdot 60 + 1 = 121 \)
   - \( (2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 + 1 = 24 \cdot 5 + 1 = 121 \)
   - \( 2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 2 \cdot 60 + 1 = 121 \)
   - Other combinations will also yield 121.

   After checking all possible placements of parentheses, it is clear that all configurations lead to the same result of 121.

4. **Final Verification**: The solution correctly identifies that all configurations yield the same value. Thus, the answer of 1 distinct value is accurate.

5. **Final Answer**: Since no errors were found, the final answer remains:

\[

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: Tom has various components for Mr. Potato Head, and we need to calculate the total number of different combinations of these components, including the option to be bald (no hair).

2. **Components Available**:
   - Hairstyles: 3 options (including bald)
   - Eyebrows: 2 sets
   - Eyes: 1 pair
   - Ears: 2 sets
   - Lips: 2 sets
   - Shoes: 2 options (regular and clown)

3. **Logical Structure**: 
   - For hairstyles, since Mr. Potato Head can be bald, we have 3 hairstyles + 1 bald option = 4 options.
   - The other components are straightforward as they have fixed options:
     - Eyebrows: 2
     - Eyes: 1
     - Ears: 2

How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"Let's analyze the problem of finding how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We need to find whole numbers between 100 and 999 (inclusive) that contain exactly one digit '0'.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculation Mistakes**: 
   - The range specified is from 100 to 999, not 99 to 999. This means we should only consider three-digit numbers.
   - A three-digit number can have a '0' in either the tens or the units place, but not in the hundreds place (as it would then not be a three-digit number).

3. **Verification of Solution**:
   - **Case 1**: '0' in the tens place (format: \(a0b\)):
