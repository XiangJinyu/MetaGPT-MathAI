"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

1. **Review the problem statement**: We have a convex pentagon with two congruent acute angles, and the other three angles are equal to the sum of the two acute angles.

2. **Check for logical errors**: 
   - Let the measure of each acute angle be \( x \). Thus, the two acute angles together measure \( 2x \).
   - The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is \( 540^\circ \).
   - The three larger angles, each equal to \( 2x \), would then sum to \( 3(2x) = 6x \).
   - Therefore, we have the equation: 
     \[
     2x + 6x = 540^\circ \implies 8x = 540^\circ \implies x = 67.5^\circ.
     \]
   - The measure of each of the larger angles is \( 2x = 2(67.5^\circ) = 135^\circ \).

3. **Verify that the solution addresses all parts**: The solution correctly identifies the angles and their relationships, and it uses all given information.

4. **Check units and format**: The answer is in degrees, which is appropriate for angle measures.

5. **Final verification**: The calculations are correct, and the answer is formatted properly.

Since no errors were found, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{135}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.0212169

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( n \) in a magic square where the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals are equal.

2. **Check for Errors**: 
   - The entries of the magic square are:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
     3 & 2n-9 & n \\
     n+1 & 1 & n-1
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - The sum of the first row is:
     \[
     (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 2n + 1
     \]
   - The sum of the second row is:
     \[
     3 + (2n-9) + n = 3n - 6
     \]
   - The sum of the third row is:
     \[
     (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = 2n + 1
     \]
   - Setting the sums of the first and second rows equal gives:
     \[
     2n + 1 = 3n - 6
     \]
     Solving this:
     \[
     1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies n = 7
     \]

3. **Verify All Parts**: 
   - The sums of the columns and diagonals should also be checked:
     - First column: 
       \[
       (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
       \]
     - Second column:
       \[
       (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
       \]
     - Third column:
       \[
       2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
       \]
     - Main diagonal:
       \[
       (n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = 4n - 13
       \]
     - Other diagonal:
       \[
       2 + (2n-9) + (n+1) = 3n - 6
       \]

4. **Check Units and Format**: The answer is a numerical value, which is appropriate.

5. **Final Verification**: The calculations confirm that \( n = 7 \) satisfies the conditions of the magic square.

Since no errors were found in the calculations and the solution is consistent, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","Let's analyze the problem and the simplified solution step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have good workers who can paint the house in 12 hours and bad workers who can do it in 36 hours. We need the house painted in 3 hours with 3 good workers and some unknown number of bad workers.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculations**:
   - The rate of work for a good worker is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of the house per hour.
   - The rate of work for a bad worker is \( \frac{1}{36} \) of the house per hour.
   - With 3 good workers, their combined rate is:
     \[
     3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the house per hour.}
     \]
   - Let \( b \) be the number of bad workers. Their combined rate is:
     \[
     b \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{b}{36} \text{ of the house per hour.}
     \]
   - The total rate of work with \( b \) bad workers is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} + \frac{b}{36}.
     \]
   - We need this total rate to complete the house in 3 hours, which means it must equal \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the house per hour:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} + \frac{b}{36} = \frac{1}{3}.
     \]

3. **Solving the Equation**:
   - To solve for \( b \), we first find a common denominator for \( \frac{1}{4} \), \( \frac{1}{3} \), and \( \frac{b}{36} \). The least common multiple of 4, 3, and 36 is 36.
   - Rewriting the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{36}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{12}{36}.
     \]
   - The equation becomes:
     \[
     \frac{9}{36} + \frac{b}{36} = \frac{12}{36}.
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     9 + b = 12 \implies b = 3.
     \]

4. **Final Verification**: The solution correctly calculates the number of bad workers needed to meet the requirement of painting the house in 3 hours.

5. **Final Answer**: The number of bad workers required is indeed 3.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.02241135

What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","Let's perform the error analysis and correction on the simplified solution.

1. **Review the problem statement and the simplified solution**: The problem asks for a common English word with a product value of 715, calculated using the letter values A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26.

2. **Check for logical errors, calculation mistakes, or misinterpretations**: 
   - The product value of the word ""SCAFFOLD"" needs to be calculated to verify if it equals 715.
   - The letter values are: S=19, C=3, A=1, F=6, F=6, O=15, L=12, D=4.

3. **Calculate the product value of ""SCAFFOLD""**:
   \[
   19 \times 3 \times 1 \times 6 \times 6 \times 15 \times 12 \times 4
   \]
   - First, calculate \(19 \times 3 = 57\).
   - Then, \(57 \times 1 = 57\).
   - Next, \(57 \times 6 = 342\).
   - Then, \(342 \times 6 = 2052\).
   - Next, \(2052 \times 15 = 30780\).
   - Then, \(30780 \times 12 = 369360\).
   - Finally, \(369360 \times 4 = 1477440\).

   The product value of ""SCAFFOLD"" is 1477440, not 715.

4. **Verify that the solution addresses all parts of the question**: The solution does not correctly identify a word with a product value of 715.

5. **Corrected solution**: We need to find a common English word whose product value equals 715.

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","Let's analyze the problem and the simplified solution step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have a square piece of paper with an area of \(49\) square inches. The side length of the square is \(\sqrt{49} = 7\) inches. When folded, two opposite corners coincide, forming two congruent triangles.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculations**: 
   - When the square is folded, the diagonal of the square becomes the base of the triangles formed. The length of the diagonal \(d\) of the square can be calculated using the formula \(d = s\sqrt{2}\), where \(s\) is the side length. Thus, \(d = 7\sqrt{2}\).
   - The height of each triangle is half the side length of the square, which is \(\frac{7}{2}\).

3. **Area of the Triangle**: The area \(A\) of one triangle can be calculated as:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 7\sqrt{2} \times \frac{7}{2} = \frac{49\sqrt{2}}{4}
   \]
   This confirms the triangles are congruent.

4. **Perimeter Calculation**: The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle consists of the two legs and the base:
   - The legs are both equal to the side length of the square, which is \(7\) inches.
   - The base is the diagonal, which is \(7\sqrt{2}\).

   Therefore, the perimeter is:
   \[
   P = 7 + 7 + 7\sqrt{2} = 14 + 7\sqrt{2}
   \]

5. **Final Answer Verification**: The answer is in the correct units (inches) and format. 

The simplified solution is correct. 

Final answer:
\(\boxed{14 + 7\sqrt{2}}\)","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.019431900000000005
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: There are three teams of four players each. Each player shakes hands three times with every member of the opposing teams and once with each member of their own team.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculation Mistakes**:
   - Each team has 4 players, so there are \(3 \times 4 = 12\) players in total.
   - Each player shakes hands with 4 teammates once, resulting in \(4 - 1 = 3\) handshakes per player with their own team.
   - Each player shakes hands with 8 opposing players (4 from each of the other two teams) three times, resulting in \(8 \times 3 = 24\) handshakes per player with opposing teams.

3. **Total Handshakes Calculation**:
   - Handshakes with own team: \(12\) players \(\times 3\) handshakes = \(36\) handshakes.
   - Handshakes with opposing teams: \(12\) players \(\times 24\) handshakes = \(288\) handshakes.
   - Total handshakes = \(36 + 288 = 324\).

4. **Final Answer Verification**: The answer must be in the correct format. 

5. **Corrected Solution**: The original simplified solution of \(162\) is incorrect. The correct total number of handshakes is \(324\).

Final answer: \(\boxed{324}\)","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

There are 12 players in total, which offers $12\times27=324$ handshakes, but since a handshake takes place between two people, we've counted every handshake twice.

"The expression $2\cdot 3 \cdot 4\cdot 5+1$ is equal to 121, since multiplication is carried out before addition. However, we can obtain values other than 121 for this expression if we are allowed to change it by inserting parentheses. For example, we can obtain 144 by writing \[
(2\cdot (3\cdot 4)) \cdot (5+1) = 144.
\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).","Let's analyze the problem and the provided simplified solution.

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: The expression given is \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\). We need to determine how many distinct values can be obtained by inserting parentheses into this expression.

2. **Check for Errors**: The original expression evaluates to \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\). The solution states that only one value can be obtained, which is incorrect. By inserting parentheses, we can create different groupings that yield different results.

3. **Verify the Solution**: Let's explore the possible ways to insert parentheses:
   - \( (2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 6 \cdot 20 + 1 = 121 \)
   - \( (2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 + 1 = (2 \cdot 12) \cdot 5 + 1 = 24 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121 \)
   - \( 2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) + 1 = 2 \cdot (3 \cdot 20) + 1 = 2 \cdot 60 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121 \)
   - \( (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 24 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121 \)
   - \( 2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 2 \cdot 60 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121 \)
   - Other combinations such as \( (2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 \) also yield 121.

   After checking various combinations, it appears that all valid groupings lead to the same result of 121.

4. **Final Verification**: Since all possible groupings yield the same value, the solution of 1 distinct value is indeed correct.

5. **Final Answer**: The final answer is confirmed to be correct.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}

"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","Let's analyze the problem and the simplified solution step by step.

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: Tom has various components for Mr. Potato Head, and we need to calculate the total number of different combinations of these components, including the option to be bald (no hair).

2. **Components Breakdown**:
   - **Hairstyles**: 3 options (including bald)
   - **Eyebrows**: 2 options
   - **Eyes**: 1 option
   - **Ears**: 2 options
   - **Lips**: 2 options
   - **Shoes**: 2 options (regular and clown)

3. **Logical Structure**: 
   - For hairstyles, since Mr. Potato Head can be bald, we have 3 hairstyles + 1 bald option = 4 options.
   - The other components are straightforward as they have fixed options.

4. **Calculation**:
   - Total combinations = (number of hairstyles) × (number of eyebrows) × (number of eyes) × (number of ears) × (number of lips) × (number of shoes)
   - Total combinations = \(4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2\)

5. **Performing the Calculation**:
   \[
   4 \times 2 = 8 \\
   8 \times 1 = 8 \\
   8 \times 2 = 16 \\
   16 \times 2 = 32 \\
   32 \times 2 = 64

How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"Let's analyze the problem of finding how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We need to find whole numbers between 100 and 999 (inclusive) that contain exactly one digit '0'.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculation Mistakes**: 
   - The range specified is from 100 to 999, not 99 to 999. 
   - We need to consider three-digit numbers where one of the digits is '0'.

3. **Solution Breakdown**:
   - The three-digit numbers can be represented as \(abc\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the digits.
   - The digit \(a\) (the hundreds place) cannot be '0' (it must be from 1 to 9).
   - The digit '0' can either be in the tens place \(b\) or the units place \(c\).

   **Case 1**: '0' in the tens place (\(b = 0\)):
   - \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
   - \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
   - Total for this case: \(9 \times 9 = 81\).

   **Case 2**: '0' in the units place (\(c = 0\)):
   - \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
   - \(b\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
   - Total for this case: \(9 \times 9 = 81\).
