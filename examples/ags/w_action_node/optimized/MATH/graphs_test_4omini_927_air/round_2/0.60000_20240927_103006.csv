"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem, we need to analyze the properties of the convex pentagon described. Let's break down the steps clearly:

1. **Understanding the Angles**:
   - Let \( x \) be the measure of each of the two congruent acute angles.
   - According to the problem, the measure of each of the other three interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. Therefore, each of these three angles measures \( 2x \).

2. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
     \]
     where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)):
     \[
     \text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
     \]

3. **Formulating the Equation**:
   - The total sum of the angles in the pentagon can be expressed as:
     \[
     2x + 3(2x) = 540^\circ
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     2x + 6x = 540^\circ
     \]
     \[
     8x = 540^\circ
     \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), divide both sides by 8:
     \[
     x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
     \]

5. **Finding the Measure of the Large Angles**:
   - The measure of each of the large angles (which are \( 2x \)) is:
     \[
     2x = 2 \times 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, the common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is:
     \[
     \boxed{135}
     \]

In conclusion, the calculations are correct, and the final answer is \( \boxed{135} \).","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.0050832

[/asy]","To solve the problem of finding the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sums of each row, column, and diagonal are equal. Let's break down the solution step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define the Magic Square

The magic square is defined as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Row Sums

1. **Row 1**: 
   \[
   (n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 = 2n + 1
   \]

2. **Row 2**: 
   \[
   3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
   \]

3. **Row 3**: 
   \[
   (n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

### Step 3: Set Up Equations

Since the sums of Row 1 and Row 2 must be equal, we can set up the equation:

\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies n = 7
\]

### Step 4: Verify with Row 3

Now, we need to verify that this value of \( n \) also satisfies the sum of Row 3:

Substituting \( n = 7 \) into Row 3:

\[
2n + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15
\]

Now, substituting \( n = 7 \) into Row 2:

\[
3n - 6 = 3(7) - 6 = 21 - 6 = 15
\]

Both Row 1 and Row 2 equal 15, and Row 3 also equals 15, confirming that the magic square property holds.

### Step 5: Final Answer

Thus, the value of \( n \) is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem of how many bad workers are needed to paint the house in 3 hours, given that we have 3 good workers, we can break down the solution step-by-step.

### Step 1: Determine the Work Rates of Workers

1. **Good Worker**: A good worker can paint the house alone in 12 hours. Therefore, the work rate of one good worker is:
   \[
   \text{Work rate of good worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
   \]

2. **Bad Worker**: A bad worker can paint the house alone in 36 hours. Therefore, the work rate of one bad worker is:
   \[
   \text{Work rate of bad worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Work Done by Good Workers

With 3 good workers, the total work done by them in one hour is:
\[
\text{Total work by good workers} = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses per hour}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Work Required

To paint the entire house in 3 hours, the total work required per hour is:
\[
\text{Total work needed per hour} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{3 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ houses per hour}
\]

### Step 4: Determine Remaining Work Needed

Now, we need to find out how much work still needs to be done after accounting for the work done by the good workers:
\[
\text{Remaining work needed} = \text{Total work needed per hour} - \text{Total work by good workers}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Remaining work needed} = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4}
\]

To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator, which is 12:
\[
\frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}
\]
Thus,
\[
\text{Remaining work needed} = \frac{4}{12} - \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate Number of Bad Workers Needed

Now, we need to find out how many bad workers are required to complete the remaining work of \(\frac{1}{12}\) houses per hour. The work done by one bad worker in one hour is \(\frac{1}{36}\) houses. Let \(x\) be the number of bad workers needed:
\[
x \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{1}{12}
\]
To solve for \(x\), we multiply both sides by 36:
\[
x = 36 \times \frac{1}{12} = 3
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the number of bad workers needed to ensure the house is painted in 3 hours, alongside the 3 good workers, is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.00761265
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To solve the problem of finding a common English word with a product value of 715, we will follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps involved in the solution:

### Step 1: Understanding Letter Values
Each letter in the English alphabet corresponds to a numerical value:
- A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26.

### Step 2: Calculating Product Value
The product value of a word is calculated by multiplying the values of its letters. For example, for the word ""CAB"":
- C = 3, A = 1, B = 2
- Product value = \(3 \times 1 \times 2 = 6\).

### Step 3: Finding the Target Product
We need to find a word whose product value equals 715.

### Step 4: Factorization of 715
To find potential combinations of letters that yield a product of 715, we can factor 715:
- The prime factorization of 715 is \(5 \times 11 \times 13\).

### Step 5: Mapping Factors to Letters
Next, we need to map these factors to letters:
- 5 corresponds to E,
- 11 corresponds to K,
- 13 corresponds to M.

Thus, one possible combination of letters that gives a product of 715 is ""EKM"".

### Step 6: Checking Common Words
Now, we need to check if ""EKM"" or any other combination of letters that yields the same product is a common English word. 

### Step 7: Review the Provided Code
The provided code attempts to find common words with a product value of 715. However, the list of common words does not include ""EKM"". We need to check other combinations of letters that could also yield a product of 715.

### Step 8: Finding Other Combinations
We can also consider other combinations of letters that multiply to 715. For example:
- 7 (G), 5 (E), 21 (U) gives \(7 \times 5 \times 21 = 735\) (too high).
- 7 (G), 15 (O), 5 (E) gives \(7 \times 15 \times 5 = 525\) (too low).
- 3 (C), 5 (E), 47 (not a letter).

After checking various combinations, we find that:
- The combination of letters that gives 715 is not straightforward.

### Step 9: Conclusion
After checking the common words provided in the code and considering the factors of 715, we conclude that there is no common English word in the provided list that has a product value of 715.

### Final Answer
Since no common English word was found with a product value of 715, we state:

\[
\text{No common English word with a product value of } 715.
\] 

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{No common English word with a product value of } 715.}
\]","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}
(5)\cdot (11) \cdot (13) &= 5\cdot 11\cdot 13 \\
(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.",0,0.009292799999999999
Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"To solve the problem of estimating \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred, we will follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Calculate the Square
First, we need to calculate the square of \( 14.7923412 \).

\[
14.7923412^2 = 14.7923412 \times 14.7923412
\]

Using a calculator or performing the multiplication, we find:

\[
14.7923412^2 \approx 219.999999
\]

### Step 2: Round to the Nearest Hundred
Next, we need to round this squared value to the nearest hundred. The value \( 219.999999 \) is closer to \( 200 \) than to \( 300 \).

To round to the nearest hundred, we look at the tens digit (which is \( 1 \) in this case). Since \( 1 < 5 \), we round down.

Thus, rounding \( 219.999999 \) to the nearest hundred gives us:

\[
\text{Rounded value} = 200
\]

### Final Answer
The final answer, after performing the calculations and rounding, is:

\[
\boxed{200}

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem, we need to analyze the situation step-by-step, ensuring all calculations are correct and clearly explained.

### Step 1: Determine the Side Length of the Square
The area of the square is given as \(49\) square inches. The formula for the area of a square is:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{side length}^2
\]

Let \(s\) be the side length of the square. We can find \(s\) by taking the square root of the area:

\[
s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Understand the Folding Process
When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, it creates two congruent right triangles. The legs of these triangles are formed by half the side length of the square.

### Step 3: Calculate the Legs of the Triangle
Since the square is folded in half, the lengths of the legs of the triangle are:

\[
\text{leg length} = \frac{s}{2} = \frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Hypotenuse of the Triangle
Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the hypotenuse \(h\) of the triangle. The hypotenuse is calculated as follows:

\[
h = \sqrt{(\text{leg length})^2 + (\text{leg length})^2} = \sqrt{(3.5)^2 + (3.5)^2}
\]

Calculating \( (3.5)^2 \):

\[
(3.5)^2 = 12.25
\]

Thus,

\[
h = \sqrt{12.25 + 12.25} = \sqrt{24.5} = \sqrt{24.5} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 6.125} = 2\sqrt{6.125}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Perimeter of One Triangle
The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides:

\[
P = \text{leg length} + \text{leg length} + \text{hypotenuse}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
P = 3.5 + 3.5 + 2\sqrt{6.125} = 7 + 2\sqrt{6.125}
\]

### Step 6: Simplify the Hypotenuse
To express \( \sqrt{6.125} \) in simplest radical form, we can rewrite \(6.125\) as:

\[
6.125 = \frac{49}{8} \quad \text{(since } 6.125 = 6 + 0.125 = 6 + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{48}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{49}{8}\text{)}
\]

Thus,

\[
\sqrt{6.125} = \sqrt{\frac{49}{8}} = \frac{7}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{4}
\]

Now substituting back into the perimeter:

\[
P = 7 + 2 \cdot \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{4} = 7 + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

### Final Answer
The perimeter of one of the triangles, expressed in simplest radical form, is:

\[
\boxed{7 + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}}
\]","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.00560685
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of calculating the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships, we will break down the problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the Setup
- There are **3 teams**.
- Each team has **4 players**.
- Each player shakes hands:
  - **Once** with each member of their own team (3 handshakes, since they do not shake hands with themselves).
  - **Three times** with each member of the opposing teams.

### Step 2: Calculate Handshakes with Own Team
Each player shakes hands with their own team members:
- Each player has 3 teammates.
- Therefore, each player shakes hands **3 times** with their own team members.

### Step 3: Calculate Handshakes with Opposing Teams
Each player shakes hands with players from the other two teams:
- There are **2 opposing teams**, and each team has **4 players**.
- Thus, each player shakes hands with \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) players from the opposing teams.
- Since each handshake with an opposing player occurs **3 times**, the total handshakes with opposing teams per player is:
  \[
  8 \text{ (opponents)} \times 3 \text{ (handshakes)} = 24 \text{ handshakes}
  \]

### Step 4: Total Handshakes per Player
Now, we can calculate the total handshakes for each player:
\[
\text{Total handshakes per player} = \text{Handshakes with own team} + \text{Handshakes with opposing teams}
\]
\[
\text{Total handshakes per player} = 3 + 24 = 27
\]

### Step 5: Calculate Total Handshakes for All Players
Now, we need to find the total number of players:
\[
\text{Total players} = 3 \text{ (teams)} \times 4 \text{ (players per team)} = 12 \text{ players}
\]
Now, we can calculate the total number of handshakes for all players:
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = \text{Total handshakes per player} \times \text{Total players}
\]
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = 27 \times 12 = 324
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships is:
\[
\boxed{324}
\]","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

There are 12 players in total, which offers $12\times27=324$ handshakes, but since a handshake takes place between two people, we've counted every handshake twice.

(2\cdot (3\cdot 4)) \cdot (5+1) = 144.
\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).","To solve the problem of how many distinct values can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses, we need to analyze the expression and the possible ways to group the multiplications.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Understanding the Expression**:
   The original expression is:
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1
   \]
   The multiplication is performed first, followed by the addition of 1.

2. **Calculating the Original Value**:
   First, we calculate the value of the expression without any parentheses:
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 = 6
   \]
   \[
   6 \cdot 4 = 24
   \]
   \[
   24 \cdot 5 = 120
   \]
   Adding 1 gives:
   \[
   120 + 1 = 121
   \]

3. **Inserting Parentheses**:
   We can insert parentheses in various ways to change the order of operations. The key is to consider all possible groupings of the numbers \(2, 3, 4, 5\) while keeping the multiplication operations intact.

4. **Possible Groupings**:
   The possible ways to group the numbers are:
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5)\)
   - \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5\)
   - \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5))\)
   - \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5\)
   - And other combinations.

5. **Calculating Distinct Values**:
   We will calculate the results for each grouping:
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 6 \cdot 20 = 120\)
   - \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 = (2 \cdot 12) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 120\)
   - \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) = 2 \cdot (3 \cdot 20) = 2 \cdot 60 = 120\)
   - \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 = 2 \cdot 12 \cdot 5 = 120\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120\)

   All these calculations yield the same result of 120.

6. **Adding 1**:
   After calculating all distinct multiplication results, we add 1 to each:
   \[
   120 + 1 = 121
   \]

7. **Conclusion**:
   Since all groupings lead to the same multiplication result of 120, the only distinct value we can obtain from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses is:
   \[
   121
   \]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of distinct values that can be obtained from the expression by inserting parentheses is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To solve the problem of how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we need to consider the various components and their combinations. Let's break down the solution step-by-step.

### Step 1: Identify the Components
Tom's Mr. Potato Head includes the following components:
- **Hairstyles**: 3 options (plus the option to be bald, which adds 1 more option)
- **Eyebrows**: 2 sets
- **Eyes**: 1 pair (only 1 option)
- **Ears**: 2 sets
- **Lips**: 2 sets
- **Shoes**: 2 sets (1 pair of regular shoes and 1 pair of clown shoes)

### Step 2: Count the Options for Each Component
- **Hairstyles**: 3 + 1 (bald) = 4 options
- **Eyebrows**: 2 options
- **Eyes**: 1 option
- **Ears**: 2 options
- **Lips**: 2 options
- **Shoes**: 2 options

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Combinations
To find the total number of different personalities, we multiply the number of options for each component together. The formula for the total number of combinations is:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = (\text{Hairstyles}) \times (\text{Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Eyes}) \times (\text{Ears}) \times (\text{Lips}) \times (\text{Shoes})
\]

Substituting the values we identified:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

### Step 4: Perform the Calculations
Now, we will perform the multiplication step-by-step:

1. \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \)
2. \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \)
3. \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \)
4. \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \)
5. \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \)

Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities Tom can create is:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 64
\]

### Final Answer
The final answer, formatted in LaTeX notation, is:

\[
\boxed{64}
\]","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.0043923
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To solve the problem of finding how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one '0', we can break down the solution step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define the Range
We are interested in whole numbers between 100 and 999 (inclusive). This is because the problem specifies numbers between 99 and 999, and the smallest three-digit number is 100.

### Step 2: Identify the Structure of the Numbers
A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
- \(a\) is the hundreds digit (can be from 1 to 9),
- \(b\) is the tens digit (can be from 0 to 9),
- \(c\) is the units digit (can be from 0 to 9).

### Step 3: Conditions for Exactly One '0'
For a number to contain exactly one '0', we can have the following scenarios:
1. The '0' is in the tens place (i.e., \(a0c\)).
2. The '0' is in the units place (i.e., \(ab0\)).

### Step 4: Count Valid Combinations
#### Case 1: '0' in the Tens Place (Form: \(a0c\))
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be '0' to ensure exactly one '0') (9 options).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \times 9 = 81
\]

#### Case 2: '0' in the Units Place (Form: \(ab0\))
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(b\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be '0' to ensure exactly one '0') (9 options).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \times 9 = 81
\]

### Step 5: Combine the Counts
Now, we add the counts from both cases:
\[
81 + 81 = 162
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of whole numbers between 99 and 999 that contain exactly one '0' is:

\[
\boxed{162}
\] 

This confirms that the output from the generated code is correct, and the calculations have been verified step-by-step.","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.00474585
