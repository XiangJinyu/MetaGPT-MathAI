"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Review the problem statement**: We have a convex pentagon with two congruent acute angles, and the other three angles are equal to the sum of the two acute angles.

2. **Logical errors or misinterpretations**: 
   - Let the measure of each acute angle be \(x\). Therefore, the two acute angles together measure \(2x\).
   - The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula \( (n-2) \times 180^\circ \), where \(n\) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, this is \(3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ\).
   - The three larger angles, each denoted as \(y\), must satisfy the equation: 
     \[
     2x + 3y = 540^\circ
     \]
   - Additionally, since each of the larger angles is equal to the sum of the two acute angles, we have:
     \[
     y = 2x
     \]

3. **Verify the solution addresses all parts**: We need to substitute \(y = 2x\) into the first equation:
   \[
   2x + 3(2x) = 540^\circ
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   2x + 6x = 540^\circ \implies 8x = 540^\circ \implies x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
   \]
   Now substituting \(x\) back to find \(y\):
   \[
   y = 2x = 2 \times 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ
   \]

4. **Ensure the answer is expressed in the required form**: The final answer is \(y = 135^\circ\), which is already in the correct form.

5. **Check for formatting issues in LaTeX notation**: The final answer is correctly formatted as \(\boxed{135}\).

After reviewing all steps, the final solution is correct. 

Final answer: \(\boxed{135}\)","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.0224166

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: The problem involves a magic square where the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal must be equal. We need to find the value of \( n \).

2. **Check for Logical Errors**: The entries in the magic square are:
   - First row: \( n-3, 3, n+1 \)
   - Second row: \( n+2, 2n-9, 1 \)
   - Third row: \( 2, n, n-1 \)

   We need to ensure that the sums of each row, column, and diagonal are equal.

3. **Verify the Solution**:
   - **Row Sums**:
     - First row: \( (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1 \)
     - Second row: \( (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6 \)
     - Third row: \( 2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1 \)

   Setting the first and second row sums equal:
   \[
   2n + 1 = 3n - 6
   \]
   Solving for \( n \):
   \[
   1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n
   \]

   Now, we check the third row sum:
   \[
   2n + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15
   \]
   The second row sum with \( n = 7 \):
   \[
   3n - 6 = 3(7) - 6 = 21 - 6 = 15
   \]
   The first row sum:
   \[
   2n + 1 = 15
   \]

   All row sums equal \( 15 \).

   - **Column Sums**:
     - First column: \( (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 2n + 1 \)
     - Second column: \( 3 + (2n-9) + n = 3n - 6 \)
     - Third column: \( (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = 2n + 1 \)

   Setting the first and second column sums equal:
   \[
   2n + 1 = 3n - 6
   \]
   This is the same equation we solved earlier, confirming \( n = 7 \).

   - **Diagonal Sums**:
     - Main diagonal: \( (n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = 4n - 13 \)
     - Other diagonal: \( (n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = 3n - 6 \)

   Setting the diagonals equal:
   \[
   4n - 13 = 3n - 6
   \]
   Solving for \( n \):
   \[
   4n - 3n = 13 - 6 \implies n = 7
   \]

4. **Final Answer Format**: The value of \( n \) is confirmed to be \( 7 \).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\] 

No errors were found in the original solution, and it is confirmed to be correct.","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have good workers who can paint the house in 12 hours and bad workers who can do it in 36 hours. We need the house painted in 3 hours with 3 good workers and some unknown number of bad workers.

2. **Logical Errors or Misinterpretations**: 
   - The rate of work for good workers is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of the house per hour.
   - The rate of work for bad workers is \( \frac{1}{36} \) of the house per hour.
   - With 3 good workers, their combined rate is \( 3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the house per hour.

3. **Addressing All Parts of the Question**: 
   - Let \( b \) be the number of bad workers. Their combined rate is \( b \times \frac{1}{36} \).
   - The total rate of work must equal the rate needed to finish the house in 3 hours, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the house per hour.

4. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} + b \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

5. **Solving the Equation**:
   - First, find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 4, 36, and 3 is 36.
   - Rewrite the equation:
   \[
   \frac{9}{36} + \frac{b}{36} = \frac{12}{36}
   \]
   - Combine the fractions:
   \[
   9 + b = 12
   \]
   - Solve for \( b \):
   \[
   b = 12 - 9 = 3
   \]

6. **Final Answer**: The number of bad workers needed is indeed 3.

7. **Formatting Check**: The final answer is correctly formatted in LaTeX.

Thus, the final answer is:

What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","Let's analyze the problem and the final solution step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We need to find a common English word whose product value equals 715, where the product value is determined by the values assigned to each letter (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26).

2. **Logical Errors or Misinterpretations**: The final solution states that there is ""No common English word"" with a product value of 715. We need to verify if this is indeed the case.

3. **Verification of Solution**: To find a word with a product value of 715, we can factor 715 into its prime factors:
   \[
   715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
   \]
   Next, we need to check if these factors correspond to any letters:
   - 5 corresponds to E
   - 11 corresponds to K
   - 13 corresponds to M

   The letters E, K, and M can be combined to form the word ""MEK"" or ""KEM"", which are not common English words. However, we can also consider combinations of letters that yield the same product.

4. **Addressing All Parts of the Question**: We need to ensure that we explore all combinations of letters that could yield a product of 715. 

5. **Formatting Issues**: The final answer is correctly formatted in LaTeX.

After further analysis, it appears that while ""MEK"" and ""KEM"" are not common English words, we can also consider other combinations. However, if we strictly adhere to the requirement for a common English word, we still find no valid candidates.

Thus, the final conclusion remains that there is no common English word with a product value of 715.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{No common English word}}
\]","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have a square piece of paper with an area of \(49\) square inches. The side length of the square is \(\sqrt{49} = 7\) inches. When folded, two opposite corners coincide, forming two congruent triangles.

2. **Logical Errors or Misinterpretations**: The folding of the square creates two right triangles. Each triangle has legs that are half the side length of the square. The legs of each triangle will be \(7\) inches (the original side length) and \(7/2\) inches (half the side length).

3. **Solution Addressing All Parts**: The area of the square is correctly identified, and the folding process is understood. However, we need to calculate the perimeter of one of the triangles formed.

4. **Perimeter Calculation**:
   - The legs of the triangle are \(7\) inches and \(7\) inches (the two sides of the triangle).
   - The hypotenuse can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     c = \sqrt{(7)^2 + (7)^2} = \sqrt{49 + 49} = \sqrt{98} = 7\sqrt{2}

   - The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle is:
     \[
     P = 7 + 7 + 7\sqrt{2} = 14 + 7\sqrt{2}

**Conclusion**: The final solution provided was incorrect in its formatting. The correct final answer is:
\[
\boxed{14 + 7\sqrt{2}} \text{ inches}

Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.024768
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have three teams of four players each. Each player shakes hands three times with every member of the opposing teams and once with each member of their own team.

2. **Logical Errors or Misinterpretations**: 
   - Each team has 4 players, so there are a total of \(3 \times 4 = 12\) players.
   - Each player shakes hands with their own team members once. Since there are 4 players in a team, each player shakes hands with 3 others in their team, resulting in \(4 \times 3 / 2 = 6\) handshakes per team (since each handshake is counted twice).

3. **Opposing Teams Handshakes**: 
   - Each player shakes hands with every player on the two opposing teams. There are \(4 + 4 = 8\) players on the opposing teams. Each player shakes hands with each of these 8 players three times, resulting in \(8 \times 3 = 24\) handshakes per player.

4. **Total Handshakes Calculation**:
   - For each player, the total handshakes are \(6\) (with their own team) + \(24\) (with opposing teams) = \(30\) handshakes.
   - Since there are \(12\) players, the total number of handshakes is \(12 \times 30 = 360\).

5. **Final Count**: However, since each handshake is counted twice (once for each participant), we need to divide by 2:
   \[
   \text{Total handshakes} = \frac{360}{2} = 180.

   - \( (2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 + 1 = (2 \cdot 12) \cdot 5 + 1 = 60 + 1 = 61 \)
   - \( 2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) + 1 = 2 \cdot 60 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121 \)
   - \( 2 \cdot ((3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5) + 1 = 2 \cdot 60 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121 \)
   - \( (2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 6 \cdot 20 + 1 = 121 \)

   - 2 sets of eyebrows
   - 1 pair of googly eyes
   - 2 sets of ears
   - 2 sets of lips
   - 2 pairs of shoes (regular and clown)

   The problem states that Mr. Potato Head can be bald, which means we have 3 options for hair (2 hairstyles + 1 bald option).

     - \(y\) can be any digit from 0 to 9, but cannot be '0' (since we want exactly one '0'), so \(y\) can be from 1 to 9 (9 options).
     - Total for this case: \(9 \times 9 = 81\).

4. **Total Count**: Adding both cases together gives:
   \[
   81 + 81 = 162
   \]

5. **Final Answer Formatting**: The answer is correctly expressed in LaTeX notation.

After reviewing the solution, I confirm that there are no errors found in the logic or calculations. The final answer is correct.

Thus, the final answer is:
\(\boxed{162}\)","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.0213351
