"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem regarding the angles of a convex pentagon, we will follow a structured approach. 

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
We have a convex pentagon with:
- Two congruent acute angles, which we will denote as \( A \).
- Three other angles, which we will denote as \( B \). According to the problem, each of these angles \( B \) is equal to the sum of the two acute angles, hence \( B = 2A \).

### Step 2: Sum of Interior Angles of a Pentagon
The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180
\]
where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)):
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180 = 3 \times 180 = 540 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 3: Setting Up the Equation
We can express the total sum of the angles in terms of \( A \):
- There are 2 acute angles: \( 2A \)
- There are 3 large angles: \( 3B = 3(2A) = 6A \)

Thus, the equation for the sum of the angles becomes:
\[
2A + 6A = 540
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
8A = 540
\]

### Step 4: Solving for \( A \)
Now, we can solve for \( A \):
\[
A = \frac{540}{8} = 67.5 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 5: Finding the Measure of Each Large Angle \( B \)
Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( B \):
\[
B = 2A = 2 \times 67.5 = 135 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Final Answer
The common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]

### Step 6: Prime Factorization of 135
Next, we will perform the prime factorization of 135:
1. Start with 135:
   - \( 135 = 3 \times 45 \)
   - \( 45 = 3 \times 15 \)
   - \( 15 = 3 \times 5 \)

Thus, the prime factorization of 135 is:
\[
135 = 3^3 \times 5^1
\]

### Summary
- The common measure of the large angles is \( \boxed{135} \).
- The prime factorization of 135 is \( 3^3 \times 5^1 \).","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.024110250000000003

[/asy]","To solve the problem of finding the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals are equal. Let's analyze the magic square step by step.

### Step 1: Set Up the Magic Square

The magic square is represented as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Sums

1. **Row Sums**:
   - First row: \( (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 2n + 1 \)
   - Second row: \( 3 + (2n-9) + n = 3n - 6 \)
   - Third row: \( (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = 2n + 1 \)

2. **Column Sums**:
   - First column: \( (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1 \)
   - Second column: \( (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6 \)
   - Third column: \( 2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1 \)

3. **Diagonal Sums**:
   - Main diagonal: \( (n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = 4n - 13 \)
   - Anti-diagonal: \( 2 + (2n-9) + (n+1) = 3n - 6 \)

### Step 3: Set Up Equations

From the sums, we can set up the following equations based on the property of the magic square (all sums must be equal):

1. From the first row and second row:
   \[
   2n + 1 = 3n - 6
   \]

2. From the diagonal sums:
   \[
   4n - 13 = 3n - 6
   \]

### Step 4: Solve the Equations

**Equation 1**:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Rearranging gives:
\[
1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n \implies n = 7
\]

**Equation 2**:
\[
4n - 13 = 3n - 6
\]
Rearranging gives:
\[
4n - 3n = -6 + 13 \implies n = 7
\]

Both equations yield the same result, confirming that \( n = 7 \).

### Step 5: Final Answer

Thus, the value of \( n \) is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\] 

This concludes the solution, confirming that all calculations are correct and consistent with the properties of the magic square.","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem of how many bad workers are needed to paint the house in 3 hours, we will follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Determine the Work Rate of Each Worker

1. **Good Workers**:
   - Each good worker can paint the house in 12 hours.
   - Therefore, the work rate of one good worker is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of good worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

2. **Bad Workers**:
   - Each bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours.
   - Therefore, the work rate of one bad worker is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of bad worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Work Done by Good Workers

- We have 3 good workers, and they will work for 3 hours. The total work done by the good workers is:
\[
\text{Total work by good workers} = \text{Number of good workers} \times \text{Work rate of good worker} \times \text{Total time}
\]
\[
= 3 \times \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} \times 3 = \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Remaining Work

- The total work needed to paint the house is 1 house. The remaining work that needs to be done by the bad workers is:
\[
\text{Remaining work} = 1 \text{ house} - \text{Total work by good workers}
\]
\[
= 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Work Done by Bad Workers

- Let \( x \) be the number of bad workers needed. The total work done by \( x \) bad workers in 3 hours is:
\[
\text{Total work by bad workers} = x \times \text{Work rate of bad worker} \times \text{Total time}
\]
\[
= x \times \frac{1}{36} \times 3 = \frac{x}{12} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 5: Set Up the Equation

- We need the work done by the bad workers to equal the remaining work:
\[
\frac{x}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 6: Solve for \( x \)

- To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by 12:
\[
x = 12 \times \frac{1}{4} = 3
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the number of bad workers needed to complete the painting of the house in 3 hours, along with the 3 good workers, is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.020497200000000004
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To solve the problem of finding a common English word with a product value of 715, we will follow a systematic approach involving prime factorization and mapping those factors to their corresponding letter values.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 715
First, we need to factor the number 715 into its prime components.

- **Dividing by 5**: 
  \[
  715 \div 5 = 143
  \]
- **Dividing 143 by 11**: 
  \[
  143 \div 11 = 13
  \]
- **13 is a prime number**.

Thus, the complete prime factorization of 715 is:
\[
715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
\]

### Step 2: Corresponding Letter Values
Next, we will map these prime factors to their corresponding letter values based on the given mapping (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26):

- **5 corresponds to E**
- **11 corresponds to K**
- **13 corresponds to M**

### Step 3: Forming the Word
Now, we can combine these letters to form a word. The letters we have are E, K, and M. 

### Step 4: Checking for Common English Words
The letters E, K, and M can be rearranged to form the word ""MEK"" or ""KEM"", but these are not common English words. However, if we consider the letters together, we can also form the word ""ME"" (which is common) and ""KE"" (which is less common).

### Conclusion
The most straightforward combination of the letters E, K, and M does not yield a common English word. However, the letters can be rearranged to form ""ME"", which is a common word.

Thus, the final answer, representing the product value of 715, can be expressed as:

\[
\boxed{EKM}
\]

This indicates that while ""EKM"" itself may not be a common word, the letters correspond to the prime factors of 715, and ""ME"" is a valid common English word derived from the letters.","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}

Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"To solve the problem of estimating \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred and performing prime factorization, we will follow a structured approach. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Square of the Target Value

First, we need to calculate the square of \( 14.7923412 \):

\[
14.7923412^2 = 14.7923412 \times 14.7923412 \approx 218.81335817721742
\]

### Step 2: Round to the Nearest Hundred

Next, we round the calculated square to the nearest hundred. The value \( 218.81335817721742 \) rounds to:

\[
\text{Rounded Value} = 200
\]

### Step 3: Perform Prime Factorization

Now, we will perform the prime factorization of the rounded value \( 200 \).

1. **Divide by 2** (the smallest prime):
   \[
   200 \div 2 = 100 \\
   100 \div 2 = 50 \\
   50 \div 2 = 25
   \]
   So, we have \( 2^3 \) from the divisions.

2. **Next, divide by 5**:
   \[
   25 \div 5 = 5 \\
   5 \div 5 = 1
   \]
   So, we have \( 5^2 \) from the divisions.

Putting it all together, the prime factorization of \( 200 \) is:

\[
200 = 2^3 \times 5^2
\]

### Step 4: List of Prime Factors and Corresponding Letter Values

Now, we will list the prime factors and their corresponding letter values based on the mapping provided:

- \( 2 \) corresponds to \( B \)
- \( 5 \) corresponds to \( E \)

Thus, the prime factorization can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Prime Factorization: } 2^3 \times 5^2
\]

And the corresponding letter values are:

- \( B \) for \( 2 \)
- \( E \) for \( 5 \)

1. **Squared Value**: \( 218.81335817721742 \)
2. **Rounded Value**: \( 200 \)
3. **Prime Factorization**: \( 2^3 \times 5^2 \)
4. **Corresponding Letter Values**: \( B, E \)

\[
\boxed{200}

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem, we need to analyze the situation where a square piece of paper is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, forming two congruent triangles. We are given that the area of the original square is \(49\) square inches. Let's break down the solution step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Side Length of the Square
The area \(A\) of a square is given by the formula:
\[
A = s^2
\]
where \(s\) is the side length of the square. Given that the area is \(49\) square inches, we can find the side length:
\[
s^2 = 49 \implies s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Understand the Folding Process
When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, the fold creates two congruent right triangles. Each triangle has legs that are half the side length of the square.

### Step 3: Calculate the Legs of the Triangle
Since the side length of the square is \(7\) inches, the legs of each triangle (which are half the side length) are:
\[
\text{leg} = \frac{s}{2} = \frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Hypotenuse of the Triangle
Using the Pythagorean theorem, the hypotenuse \(h\) of the triangle can be calculated as follows:
\[
h = \sqrt{\text{leg}^2 + \text{leg}^2} = \sqrt{(3.5)^2 + (3.5)^2} = \sqrt{12.25 + 12.25} = \sqrt{24.5}
\]
To simplify \(\sqrt{24.5}\):
\[
\sqrt{24.5} = \sqrt{4 \times 6.125} = 2\sqrt{6.125}
\]
However, we can also express \(24.5\) as:
\[
24.5 = \frac{49}{2} \implies h = \sqrt{\frac{49}{2}} = \frac{7}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Perimeter of One Triangle
The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides:
\[
P = \text{leg} + \text{leg} + \text{hypotenuse} = 3.5 + 3.5 + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
P = 7 + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

### Step 6: Express the Perimeter in Simplest Radical Form
To express the perimeter in a single fraction:
\[
P = 7 + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{14}{2} + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{14 + 7\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the perimeter of one of the triangles, expressed in simplest radical form, is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{14 + 7\sqrt{2}}{2}}
\]","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.022746750000000003
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of counting the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships, we will break down the calculations step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the Setup
- There are **3 teams**.
- Each team has **4 players**.
- Each player shakes hands:
  - **3 times** with each member of the opposing teams.
  - **1 time** with each member of their own team.

### Step 2: Calculate Total Players
The total number of players can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Total Players} = \text{Number of Teams} \times \text{Players per Team} = 3 \times 4 = 12
\]

### Step 3: Handshakes with Opposing Teams
Each player shakes hands with players from the opposing teams. Since there are 2 opposing teams (each with 4 players), each player shakes hands with:
\[
\text{Opposing Players} = 4 \text{ (from Team 1)} + 4 \text{ (from Team 2)} = 8
\]
Thus, each player shakes hands **3 times** with each of these 8 players:
\[
\text{Handshakes with Opponents per Player} = 3 \times 8 = 24
\]

### Step 4: Handshakes with Own Team
Each player shakes hands **once** with each of the other 3 players on their own team:
\[
\text{Handshakes with Own Team per Player} = 3
\]

### Step 5: Total Handshakes per Player
Now, we can calculate the total handshakes for each player:
\[
\text{Total Handshakes per Player} = \text{Handshakes with Opponents} + \text{Handshakes with Own Team} = 24 + 3 = 27
\]

### Step 6: Total Handshakes for All Players
Since there are 12 players, the total number of handshakes is:
\[
\text{Total Handshakes} = \text{Total Handshakes per Player} \times \text{Total Players} = 27 \times 12 = 324
\]

### Step 7: Adjust for Double Counting
However, each handshake is counted twice (once for each participant), so we need to divide by 2:
\[
\text{Final Total Handshakes} = \frac{324}{2} = 162
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of handshakes at the national curling championships is:
\[
\boxed{162}
\] 

### Prime Factorization of 162
To find the prime factorization of 162:
1. Divide by 2: \(162 \div 2 = 81\)
2. Divide by 3: \(81 \div 3 = 27\)
3. Divide by 3: \(27 \div 3 = 9\)
4. Divide by 3: \(9 \div 3 = 3\)
5. Divide by 3: \(3 \div 3 = 1\)

Thus, the prime factorization of 162 is:
\[
162 = 2^1 \times 3^4
\]

### Summary of Prime Factors
- Prime factors: \(2\) and \(3\)
- Corresponding letter values:
  - \(2 \rightarrow B\)
  - \(3 \rightarrow C\)

The final answer for the total number of handshakes is:
\[
\boxed{162}
\]","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

There are 12 players in total, which offers $12\times27=324$ handshakes, but since a handshake takes place between two people, we've counted every handshake twice.

The final answer is $\dfrac{324}{2}=\boxed{162}$ handshakes.",1,0.015392250000000001

(2\cdot (3\cdot 4)) \cdot (5+1) = 144.
\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).","To solve the problem of how many distinct values can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses, we will systematically explore the different ways to group the terms using parentheses.

### Step 1: Understanding the Expression
The original expression is:
\[
2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1
\]
Calculating the product without parentheses gives:
\[
2 \cdot 3 = 6, \quad 6 \cdot 4 = 24, \quad 24 \cdot 5 = 120
\]
Thus, the expression evaluates to:
\[
120 + 1 = 121

### Step 2: Inserting Parentheses
We can insert parentheses in various ways to change the order of operations. The key is to consider all possible groupings of the four numbers \(2\), \(3\), \(4\), and \(5\). 

Here are the different ways to insert parentheses:

1. **No parentheses**:
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 121

   - \((2 \cdot 5) \cdot (3 \cdot 4) + 1 = 10 \cdot 12 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)

3. **One pair and one single**:
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \((2 \cdot 4) \cdot 3 \cdot 5 + 1 = 8 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \((2 \cdot 5) \cdot 3 \cdot 4 + 1 = 10 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 2 \cdot 12 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 5) \cdot 4 + 1 = 2 \cdot 15 \cdot 4 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \(2 \cdot (4 \cdot 5) \cdot 3 + 1 = 2 \cdot 20 \cdot 3 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)

4. **All combinations**:
   - \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 + 1 = (6 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \((2 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) \cdot 3 + 1 = (40) \cdot 3 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \((3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) \cdot 2 + 1 = (60) \cdot 2 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)

### Step 3: Unique Values
After evaluating all possible groupings, we find that all combinations yield the same result of \(121\). 

### Conclusion
Thus, the total number of distinct values that can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.
\end{align*}In total there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for the expression.",0,0.023444700000000002
"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To solve the problem of how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we will follow a structured approach. 

### Step 1: Identify the Options for Each Feature
Tom's Mr. Potato Head comes with the following options:
- **Hairstyles**: 3 options (including the option to be bald)
- **Eyebrows**: 2 options
- **Eyes**: 1 option
- **Ears**: 2 options
- **Lips**: 2 options
- **Shoes**: 2 options (regular and clown)

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Number of Personalities
To find the total number of different personalities, we multiply the number of options for each feature:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = (\text{Hairstyles}) \times (\text{Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Eyes}) \times (\text{Ears}) \times (\text{Lips}) \times (\text{Shoes})
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \)
2. \( 6 \times 1 = 6 \)
3. \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \)
4. \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \)
5. \( 24 \times 2 = 48 \)

Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities is:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 48
\]

### Step 3: Prime Factorization of 48
Next, we need to find the prime factorization of 48. 

1. Start with the number 48.
2. Divide by 2 (the smallest prime number):
   - \( 48 \div 2 = 24 \)
   - \( 24 \div 2 = 12 \)
   - \( 12 \div 2 = 6 \)
   - \( 6 \div 2 = 3 \)
   - \( 3 \div 3 = 1 \)

Thus, we can express 48 as:

\[
48 = 2^4 \times 3^1
\]

### Step 4: Summary of Results
- **Total different wacky personalities**: 48
- **Prime Factorization**: \( 48 = 2^4 \times 3^1 \)

### Step 5: Corresponding Letter Values
Using the prime factorization, we can assign letter values:
- \( 2 \) corresponds to \( B \)
- \( 3 \) corresponds to \( C \)

Thus, we summarize the counts:
- \( 2 \) appears 4 times (B)
- \( 3 \) appears 1 time (C)

### Final Answer
The final answer, formatted in LaTeX notation, is:

\[
\boxed{48}
\]

And the prime factorization is:

\[
\boxed{48 = 2^4 \times 3^1}
\]

With the corresponding letter values:
- B (4 times)
- C (1 time)","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",0,0.021763500000000005
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To solve the problem of how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one '0', we can break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define the Range
We are interested in three-digit numbers, which range from 100 to 999. 

### Step 2: Identify the Structure of the Numbers
A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
- \(a\) is the hundreds digit (can be from 1 to 9),
- \(b\) is the tens digit (can be from 0 to 9),
- \(c\) is the units digit (can be from 0 to 9).

### Step 3: Conditions for Exactly One '0'
To have exactly one '0' in the number \(abc\), we can have the following cases:
1. \(a = 1, 2, \ldots, 9\) (not '0'), \(b = 0\), \(c \neq 0\)
2. \(a = 1, 2, \ldots, 9\) (not '0'), \(b \neq 0\), \(c = 0\)

### Step 4: Count the Valid Combinations
#### Case 1: \(b = 0\)
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
  
Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \text{ (choices for } a\text{)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for } c\text{)} = 81
\]

#### Case 2: \(c = 0\)
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(b\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \text{ (choices for } a\text{)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for } b\text{)} = 81
\]

### Step 5: Combine the Results
Now, we add the results from both cases:
\[
81 \text{ (from case 1)} + 81 \text{ (from case 2)} = 162
\]

### Final Answer
The total number of whole numbers between 99 and 999 that contain exactly one '0' is:
\[
\boxed{162}
\] 

This confirms the output from the provided code, which correctly counts the numbers with exactly one '0'. There are no errors in the code or its output.","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.014861100000000002
