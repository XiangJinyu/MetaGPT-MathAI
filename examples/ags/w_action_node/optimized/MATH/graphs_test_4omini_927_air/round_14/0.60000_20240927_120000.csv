"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem regarding the angles of a convex pentagon, we will follow a structured approach. 

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let:
- \( x \) be the measure of each acute angle (in degrees).
- \( y \) be the measure of each large angle (in degrees).

### Step 2: Establish Relationships
From the problem statement, we know:
1. There are two acute angles, so their total contribution to the angle sum is \( 2x \).
2. The other three angles are large angles, and each large angle is equal to the sum of the two acute angles. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   y = 2x
   \]
   (since the measure of each large angle is equal to the sum of the two acute angles).

### Step 3: Use the Sum of Interior Angles
The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180
\]
where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)):
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180 = 3 \times 180 = 540 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 4: Set Up the Equation
The total sum of the angles can be expressed as:
\[
2x + 3y = 540
\]
Substituting \( y = 2x \) into the equation gives:
\[
2x + 3(2x) = 540
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 6x = 540
\]
\[
8x = 540
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
Now, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{540}{8} = 67.5 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate \( y \)
Now, substituting \( x \) back to find \( y \):
\[
y = 2x = 2 \times 67.5 = 135 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Conclusion
The common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]

### Verification
To verify, we can check the total sum of the angles:
- Two acute angles: \( 2 \times 67.5 = 135 \)
- Three large angles: \( 3 \times 135 = 405 \)
- Total: \( 135 + 405 = 540 \) degrees, which is correct.

Thus, the calculations are correct, and the final answer is \( \boxed{135} \).","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.015773399999999996

[/asy]","To solve the problem of finding the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sums of each row, column, and both diagonals are equal. Let's analyze the magic square step by step.

### Step 1: Define the Magic Square

The magic square is defined as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Sums

1. **Row Sums:**
   - Row 1: \( (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 2n + 1 \)
   - Row 2: \( 3 + (2n-9) + n = 3n - 6 \)
   - Row 3: \( (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = 2n + 1 \)

2. **Column Sums:**
   - Column 1: \( (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1 \)
   - Column 2: \( (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6 \)
   - Column 3: \( 2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1 \)

3. **Diagonal Sums:**
   - Diagonal 1: \( (n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = 4n - 13 \)
   - Diagonal 2: \( 2 + (2n-9) + (n+1) = 3n - 6 \)

### Step 3: Set Up Equations

For the magic square to be valid, all row sums, column sums, and diagonal sums must be equal. We can set the equations based on the sums we calculated:

1. From Row 1 and Row 2:
   \[
   2n + 1 = 3n - 6
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   6 + 1 = 3n - 2n \implies n = 7
   \]

2. We can verify that this value satisfies the other sums:
   - Row 3: \( 2n + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15 \)
   - Column 1: \( 2n + 1 = 15 \)
   - Column 3: \( 2n + 1 = 15 \)
   - Diagonal 2: \( 3n - 6 = 3(7) - 6 = 21 - 6 = 15 \)

### Step 4: Verify the Magic Square

Now, substituting \( n = 7 \) into the magic square:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
4 & 9 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 5 & 7 \\
\hline
8 & 1 & 6 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Calculating the sums:
- Rows: \( 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \), \( 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \), \( 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \)
- Columns: \( 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \), \( 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \), \( 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \)
- Diagonals: \( 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \), \( 2 + 5 + 8 = 15 \)

All sums are equal to 15, confirming that the magic square is valid.

### Final Answer

Thus, the value of \( n \) is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem of how many bad workers are needed to paint the house in 3 hours, we will follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Define the Work Rates

1. **Good Worker**: A good worker can paint the house alone in 12 hours. Therefore, the work rate of one good worker is:
   \[
   \text{Work rate of good worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
   \]

2. **Bad Worker**: A bad worker can paint the house alone in 36 hours. Therefore, the work rate of one bad worker is:
   \[
   \text{Work rate of bad worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Work Done by Good Workers

We have 3 good workers. The total work done by these good workers in 3 hours is:
\[
\text{Total work by good workers} = \text{Number of good workers} \times \text{Work rate of good worker} \times \text{Time}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Total work by good workers} = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} \times 3 = \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Remaining Work

The total work needed to paint the house is 1 house. The remaining work that needs to be done by bad workers is:
\[
\text{Remaining work} = \text{Total work needed} - \text{Total work by good workers}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Remaining work} = 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Number of Bad Workers Needed

Let \( x \) be the number of bad workers needed. The equation for the work done by bad workers in 3 hours is:
\[
x \times \text{Work rate of bad worker} \times \text{Time} = \text{Remaining work}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
x \times \frac{1}{36} \times 3 = \frac{1}{4}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x \times \frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{4}
\]
\[
x \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
\]
Multiplying both sides by 12 gives:
\[
x = 12 \times \frac{1}{4} = 3
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the number of bad workers needed to complete the painting of the house in 3 hours is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\] 

This means that in addition to the 3 good workers, you will need 3 bad workers to ensure the house is painted on time.","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.

Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.016724399999999997

What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To solve the problem of finding a common English word with a product value of 715, we will follow these steps:

1. **Understanding the Product Value**: The product value of a word is calculated by multiplying the values assigned to each letter (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26). 

2. **Prime Factorization of 715**: The prime factorization of 715 is given as:
   \[
   715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
   \]
   This means that the letters corresponding to these prime factors must be included in the word.

3. **Mapping Letters to Values**:
   - The letter corresponding to 5 is E.
   - The letter corresponding to 11 is K.
   - The letter corresponding to 13 is M.

4. **Constructing Possible Words**: We need to find combinations of these letters that form common English words. The letters we have are E, K, and M. We can also consider combinations of these letters with repetitions or additional letters that do not affect the product value.

5. **Checking Common Words**: We will check combinations of the letters E, K, and M, and see if they form any common English words. 

6. **Using the Provided Code**: The provided code checks a predefined list of common words. We will use this list to find any matches.

   - For the word ""M"": \( 13 \)
   - For the word ""EK"": \( 5 \times 11 = 55 \)

3. **Conclusion**: After checking the combinations, we find that the word ""ME"" does not yield the product value of 715. However, we can also consider longer words or combinations that include these letters.

### Final Answer
After checking the combinations and the provided list of common words, we find that there are no common English words that yield a product value of 715 based on the letters E, K, and M. 

Thus, the final answer is:

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given information about the square piece of paper and the triangles formed when it is folded.

1. **Area of the Square**: The area of the square is given as \(49\) square inches. 

2. **Finding the Side Length**: The side length \(s\) of the square can be calculated using the formula for the area of a square:
   \[
   s^2 = \text{Area} \implies s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Folding the Square**: When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, it creates two congruent right triangles. The base and height of each triangle are equal to half the side length of the square.

4. **Base and Height of the Triangle**: 
   \[
   \text{Base} = \text{Height} = \frac{s}{2} = \frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Calculating the Hypotenuse**: The hypotenuse \(h\) of the triangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   h = \sqrt{\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{s}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\left(3.5\right)^2 + \left(3.5\right)^2} = \sqrt{12.25 + 12.25} = \sqrt{24.5} = \sqrt{24.5} = \sqrt{\frac{49}{2}} = \frac{7}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}

6. **Calculating the Perimeter of One Triangle**: The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle is the sum of its base, height, and hypotenuse:
   \[
   P = \text{Base} + \text{Height} + \text{Hypotenuse} = 3.5 + 3.5 + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying this:
   \[
   P = 7 + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}

   To express this in a single fraction:
   \[
   P = \frac{14}{2} + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{14 + 7\sqrt{2}}{2}

"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of counting the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships, we will break down the calculations step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the Setup
- There are **3 teams**.
- Each team has **4 players**.
- Each player shakes hands:
  - **3 times** with each member of the opposing teams.
  - **1 time** with each member of their own team.

### Step 2: Calculate Total Players
The total number of players in the championship is:
\[
\text{Total Players} = \text{Number of Teams} \times \text{Players per Team} = 3 \times 4 = 12
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Handshakes with Opposing Teams
Each player shakes hands with players from the other two teams. Each player shakes hands **3 times** with each of the **8 opposing players** (4 players from each of the 2 opposing teams):
\[
\text{Handshakes with Opponents} = 3 \times 8 = 24
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Handshakes with Own Team
Each player shakes hands **1 time** with each of the **3 other players** on their own team:
\[
\text{Handshakes with Own Team} = 3
\]

### Step 5: Total Handshakes per Player
Now, we can calculate the total handshakes for each player:
\[
\text{Total Handshakes per Player} = \text{Handshakes with Opponents} + \text{Handshakes with Own Team} = 24 + 3 = 27
\]

### Step 6: Calculate Total Handshakes for All Players
Now, we multiply the total handshakes per player by the total number of players:
\[
\text{Total Handshakes} = \text{Total Players} \times \text{Total Handshakes per Player} = 12 \times 27 = 324
\]

### Step 7: Adjust for Double Counting
Since each handshake involves two players, we have counted each handshake twice. Therefore, we need to divide the total by 2:
\[
\text{Final Total Handshakes} = \frac{324}{2} = 162
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of handshakes that occur during the championships is:
\[
\boxed{162}
\]

### Verification of Prime Factors
The prime factors provided were [2, 3, 5, 7]. The number 162 can be factored as follows:
\[
162 = 2 \times 81 = 2 \times 3^4
\]
Thus, the prime factors of 162 are indeed 2 and 3, but not 5 or 7. Therefore, the prime factorization is correct, and the final answer remains:
\[
\boxed{162}
\]","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

There are 12 players in total, which offers $12\times27=324$ handshakes, but since a handshake takes place between two people, we've counted every handshake twice.

(2\cdot (3\cdot 4)) \cdot (5+1) = 144.
\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).","To solve the problem of how many distinct values can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses, we will systematically explore the different ways to group the multiplications using parentheses.

### Step 1: Understanding the Expression
The original expression is:
\[
2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1
\]
Calculating the multiplication first:
\[
2 \cdot 3 = 6
\]
\[
6 \cdot 4 = 24
\]
\[
24 \cdot 5 = 120
\]
Thus, the expression evaluates to:
\[
120 + 1 = 121
\]

### Step 2: Inserting Parentheses
We can insert parentheses in various ways to change the order of operations. The key is to consider all possible groupings of the four numbers \(2\), \(3\), \(4\), and \(5\). 

Here are the distinct groupings we can consider:

1. **No parentheses**:
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 121
   \]

2. **Two pairs**:
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5)\)
   - \((2 \cdot 4) \cdot (3 \cdot 5)\)
   - \((2 \cdot 5) \cdot (3 \cdot 4)\)

3. **One pair and one single**:
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5\)
   - \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5\)
   - \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)\)

4. **All combinations of one number with the product of the others**:
   - \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5))\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 + 5)\)
   - \((2 + 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5)\)
   - \((2 + (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5\)
   - \(2 \cdot (3 + (4 \cdot 5))\)

### Step 3: Calculating Each Grouping
Now we will calculate the values for each grouping:

1. **No parentheses**:
   \[
   121
   \]

2. **Two pairs**:
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 6 \cdot 20 = 120 \Rightarrow 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \((2 \cdot 4) \cdot (3 \cdot 5) = 8 \cdot 15 = 120 \Rightarrow 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \((2 \cdot 5) \cdot (3 \cdot 4) = 10 \cdot 12 = 120 \Rightarrow 120 + 1 = 121\)

3. **One pair and one single**:
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 120 \Rightarrow 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 = 2 \cdot 12 \cdot 5 = 120 \Rightarrow 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 20 = 120 \Rightarrow 120 + 1 = 121\)

4. **All combinations**:
   - \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) = 2 \cdot 60 = 120 \Rightarrow 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 + 5) = 6 \cdot 9 = 54 \Rightarrow 54 + 1 = 55\)
   - \((2 + 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 5 \cdot 20 = 100 \Rightarrow 100 + 1 = 101\)
   - \((2 + (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 = (2 + 12) \cdot 5 = 14 \cdot 5 = 70 \Rightarrow 70 + 1 = 71\)
   - \(2 \cdot (3 + (4 \cdot 5)) = 2 \cdot (3 + 20) = 2 \cdot 23 = 46 \Rightarrow 46 + 1 = 47\)

### Step 4: Collecting Distinct Values
From our calculations, we have the following distinct results:
- \(121\)
- \(55\)
- \(101\)
- \(70\)
- \(47\)

### Final Count of Distinct Values
The distinct values obtained are \(121\), \(55\), \(101\), \(70\), and \(47\). Thus, the total number of distinct values is:

\[
\text{Total distinct values} = 5
\]

### Final Answer
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.
\end{align*}In total there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for the expression.",0,0.02379585
"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To solve the problem of how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we need to consider the options available for each feature and how they combine.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Identify the Features and Their Options**:
   - **Hairstyles**: 3 options (plus 1 option for being bald)
   - **Eyebrows**: 2 options
   - **Eyes**: 1 option (googly eyes)
   - **Ears**: 2 options
   - **Lips**: 2 options
   - **Shoes**: 2 options (1 pair of regular shoes + 1 pair of clown shoes)

2. **Calculate the Total Options for Each Feature**:
   - For hairstyles, since Mr. Potato Head can be bald, we have:
     \[
     \text{Total hairstyles} = 3 + 1 = 4
     \]
   - The other features have the following options:
     - Eyebrows: 2
     - Eyes: 1
     - Ears: 2
     - Lips: 2
     - Shoes: 2

3. **Calculate the Total Number of Personalities**:
   The total number of different personalities can be calculated by multiplying the number of options for each feature:
   \[
   \text{Total personalities} = (\text{Total hairstyles}) \times (\text{Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Eyes}) \times (\text{Ears}) \times (\text{Lips}) \times (\text{Shoes})
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total personalities} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - First, calculate \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
   - Then, \(8 \times 1 = 8\)
   - Next, \(8 \times 2 = 16\)
   - Then, \(16 \times 2 = 32\)
   - Finally, \(32 \times 2 = 64\)

Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities Tom can create is:
\[
\text{Total personalities} = 64
\]

### Conclusion
The final answer, formatted in LaTeX notation, is:
\[
\boxed{64}
\]

### Prime Factorization
The problem also mentions a target product value of 72 with a prime factorization of \([2, 2, 2, 3, 3]\). However, this is not relevant to the calculation of the number of personalities, which is correctly calculated as 64. The prime factorization of 64 is \([2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\), which is different from the prime factorization of 72. Thus, the calculations and the final answer are correct.","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.014890949999999997
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To solve the problem of counting how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one '0', we can break down the solution step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define the Range
We are interested in whole numbers between 100 and 999 (inclusive). This is because the problem specifies numbers between 99 and 999, and the smallest three-digit number is 100.

### Step 2: Identify the Structure of the Numbers
A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
- \(a\) is the hundreds digit (can be from 1 to 9),
- \(b\) is the tens digit (can be from 0 to 9),
- \(c\) is the units digit (can be from 0 to 9).

### Step 3: Conditions for Exactly One '0'
For a number to contain exactly one '0', we can have the following scenarios:
1. The '0' is in the tens place: \(a0c\)
2. The '0' is in the units place: \(ab0\)

### Step 4: Count Valid Combinations
#### Case 1: '0' in the Tens Place (Form: \(a0c\))
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be '0' to satisfy the condition of having exactly one '0') (9 options).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \times 9 = 81
\]

#### Case 2: '0' in the Units Place (Form: \(ab0\))
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(b\) can be any digit from 0 to 9, but it cannot be '0' (to satisfy the condition of having exactly one '0') (10 options).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \times 10 = 90
\]

### Step 5: Combine the Counts
Now, we add the counts from both cases:
\[
81 + 90 = 171
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of whole numbers between 100 and 999 that contain exactly one '0' is:

\[
\boxed{171}
\]","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",0,0.018021449999999998
