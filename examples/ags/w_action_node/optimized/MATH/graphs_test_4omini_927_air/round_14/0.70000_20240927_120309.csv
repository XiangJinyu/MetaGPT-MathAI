"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem regarding the angles of a convex pentagon, we will follow a step-by-step approach to ensure clarity and correctness.

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
We have a convex pentagon with:
- Two congruent acute angles, which we will denote as \( x \).
- The other three angles are each equal to the sum of the two acute angles, which is \( 2x \).

### Step 2: Sum of Interior Angles
The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180
\]
where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)):
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180 = 3 \times 180 = 540 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 3: Setting Up the Equation
The total measure of the angles in the pentagon can be expressed as:
\[
2x + 3(2x) = 540
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 6x = 540
\]
\[
8x = 540
\]

### Step 4: Solving for \( x \)
Now, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{540}{8} = 67.5 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 5: Finding the Measure of the Large Angles
The measure of each of the three larger angles is:
\[
2x = 2 \times 67.5 = 135 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Conclusion
Thus, the common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]

### Verification
To verify, we can check the total sum of the angles:
- Two acute angles: \( 2 \times 67.5 = 135 \)
- Three larger angles: \( 3 \times 135 = 405 \)

Adding these together:
\[
135 + 405 = 540 \text{ degrees}
\]
This confirms that our calculations are correct. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.015992099999999995

[/asy]","To solve the problem of finding the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sums of the numbers in each row, column, and the two main diagonals are equal.

### Step 1: Set Up the Magic Square

The magic square is represented as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Magic Constant

In a \( 3 \times 3 \) magic square, the magic constant \( S \) can be calculated as:

\[
S = \frac{3 \times \text{(sum of all elements)}}{3} = \text{(sum of all elements)}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Sums of Rows

1. **First Row:**
   \[
   (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 2n + 1
   \]

2. **Second Row:**
   \[
   3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
   \]

3. **Third Row:**
   \[
   (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

### Step 4: Set Up Equations

Since the sums of the first and second rows must be equal (as they are part of the magic square), we can set up the equation:

\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( n \)

Rearranging the equation gives:

\[
2n + 1 + 6 = 3n
\]
\[
7 = n
\]

### Step 6: Verify with Other Rows and Columns

Now we will verify if \( n = 7 \) satisfies the conditions of the magic square.

1. **First Row:**
   \[
   (7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
   \]

2. **Second Row:**
   \[
   3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
   \]

3. **Third Row:**
   \[
   (7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
   \]

4. **First Column:**
   \[
   (7-3) + 3 + (7+1) = 4 + 3 + 8 = 15
   \]

5. **Second Column:**
   \[
   (7+2) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 1 = 9 + 5 + 1 = 15
   \]

6. **Third Column:**
   \[
   2 + 7 + (7-1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
   \]

7. **Main Diagonal:**
   \[
   (7-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
   \]

8. **Anti-Diagonal:**
   \[
   2 + (2n-9) + (7-3) = 2 + 5 + 4 = 15
   \]

### Conclusion

Since all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to 15, the value of \( n \) is confirmed to be correct.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem of how many bad workers are needed to paint the house in 3 hours, we will follow a step-by-step approach, ensuring all calculations are correct.

### Step 1: Define the Work Rates

1. **Good Worker**: A good worker can paint the house alone in 12 hours.
   - Work rate of one good worker:
   \[
   \text{Work rate of good worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
   \]

2. **Bad Worker**: A bad worker can paint the house alone in 36 hours.
   - Work rate of one bad worker:
   \[
   \text{Work rate of bad worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Work Done by Good Workers

- We have 3 good workers available, and they will work for 3 hours.
- Total work done by good workers in 3 hours:
\[
\text{Total work by good workers} = \text{Number of good workers} \times \text{Work rate of good worker} \times \text{Time available}
\]
\[
= 3 \times \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} \times 3 = \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Remaining Work

- The total work needed to paint the house is 1 house.
- Remaining work after good workers:
\[
\text{Remaining work} = \text{Total work needed} - \text{Total work by good workers}
\]
\[
= 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Work Done by Bad Workers

- Let \( n \) be the number of bad workers needed.
- The work done by one bad worker in 3 hours:
\[
\text{Work done by one bad worker in 3 hours} = \text{Work rate of bad worker} \times \text{Time available}
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{36} \times 3 = \frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 5: Set Up the Equation for Bad Workers

- The total work done by \( n \) bad workers in 3 hours must equal the remaining work:
\[
n \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 6: Solve for \( n \)

- Rearranging the equation:
\[
n = \frac{1/4}{1/12} = \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{12}{1} = 3
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the number of bad workers needed to complete the painting of the house in 3 hours is \( n = 3 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.015656849999999996
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To solve the problem of finding a common English word with a product value of 715, we first need to understand the prime factorization of the target product value and how it relates to the letter values.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization
The prime factorization of 715 is given as:
\[
715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
\]

### Step 2: Mapping Prime Factors to Letter Values
Next, we need to identify which letters correspond to these prime factors based on their values:
- The letter values are defined as follows:
  - A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26.
  
From the prime factors:
- 5 corresponds to the letter E (since E = 5).
- 11 corresponds to the letter K (since K = 11).
- 13 corresponds to the letter M (since M = 13).

### Step 3: Forming Words
Now, we can form combinations of these letters to find common English words. The letters we have are E, K, and M. We can also consider combinations of these letters with repetitions or additional letters to form valid words.

### Step 4: Checking Common Words
We will check combinations of the letters E, K, and M, as well as other letters that could potentially yield a product of 715. 

1. **Single Letters**: E, K, M
2. **Two Letters**: EK, EM, KE, KM, ME, MK
3. **Three Letters**: EKM, KEM, MEK, MKE, EK, EM, etc.

However, we need to focus on common English words. 

### Step 5: Finding Valid Words
From the list of common words provided in the code:
- ""CAB"" (3 × 1 × 2 = 6)
- ""BAD"" (2 × 1 × 4 = 8)
- ""DAD"" (4 × 1 × 4 = 16)
- ""ACE"" (1 × 3 × 5 = 15)
- ""BEE"" (2 × 5 × 5 = 50)
- ""FAD"" (6 × 1 × 4 = 24)
- ""FACE"" (6 × 1 × 3 × 5 = 90)
- ""CAGE"" (3 × 1 × 7 × 5 = 105)
- ""BAG"" (2 × 1 × 7 = 14)
- ""FAD"" (repeated)
- ""DEED"" (4 × 5 × 5 × 4 = 100)
- ""BEE"" (repeated)
- ""FED"" (6 × 5 × 4 = 120)
- ""CAFE"" (3 × 1 × 6 × 5 = 90)
- ""BEAD"" (2 × 5 × 1 × 4 = 40)
- ""CABBAGE"" (3 × 1 × 2 × 2 × 1 × 7 × 5 = 420)
- ""BADGE"" (2 × 1 × 4 × 7 × 5 = 280)
- ""FACE"" (repeated)
- ""DECADE"" (4 × 5 × 3 × 1 × 4 × 5 = 1200)

None of these words yield a product value of 715.

### Step 6: Conclusion
After checking the combinations and the provided list of common words, it appears that there are no common English words that yield a product value of 715 based on the letter values derived from the prime factors.

Thus, the final answer is that there is no common English word with a product value of 715.

\[
\text{Final Answer: } \boxed{\text{No common English word found}}
\]","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}

Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"To solve the problem of estimating \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the square of the number**: We need to compute \( 14.7923412^2 \).
2. **Round the result to the nearest hundred**: After calculating the square, we will round the result to the nearest hundred.
3. **Verify the calculations**: Ensure that all calculations are correct and check the final output.

### Step 1: Calculate the square of the number

We start with the number \( 14.7923412 \):

\[
squared\_value = 14.7923412^2
\]

Calculating this:

\[
squared\_value = 14.7923412 \times 14.7923412 \approx 219.999999
\]

### Step 2: Round the result to the nearest hundred

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem, we need to analyze the situation step-by-step, ensuring all calculations are correct and the final answer is expressed in the required format.

### Step 1: Calculate the Side Length of the Square
Given that the area of the square is \(49\) square inches, we can find the side length of the square using the formula for the area of a square:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{side length}^2
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\text{side length} = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Dimensions of the Triangle
When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, it creates two congruent right triangles. 

- The base of each triangle is half the side length of the square:

\[
\text{base} = \frac{\text{side length}}{2} = \frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \text{ inches}
\]

- The height of the triangle is equal to the side length of the square:

\[
\text{height} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Hypotenuse Using the Pythagorean Theorem
The hypotenuse of the triangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
\text{hypotenuse} = \sqrt{(\text{base})^2 + (\text{height})^2}
\]

Substituting the values we found:

\[
\text{hypotenuse} = \sqrt{(3.5)^2 + (7)^2} = \sqrt{12.25 + 49} = \sqrt{61.25}
\]

To express \(\sqrt{61.25}\) in simplest radical form, we can rewrite it as:

\[
\sqrt{61.25} = \sqrt{\frac{245}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{245}}{2} = \frac{7\sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Perimeter of One Triangle
The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle is the sum of its three sides:

\[
P = \text{base} + \text{height} + \text{hypotenuse}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
P = 3.5 + 7 + \frac{7\sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

Converting \(3.5\) to a fraction gives us:

\[
3.5 = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Thus, we can rewrite the perimeter as:

\[
P = \frac{7}{2} + 7 + \frac{7\sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

To combine these, we convert \(7\) to a fraction with a denominator of \(2\):

\[
7 = \frac{14}{2}
\]

Now we can combine the terms:

\[
P = \frac{7}{2} + \frac{14}{2} + \frac{7\sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{21 + 7\sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the perimeter of one of the triangles, expressed in simplest radical form, is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{21 + 7\sqrt{5}}{2}}
\]","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.016490999999999995
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of calculating the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships, we will break down the steps clearly and ensure all calculations are correct.

### Step 1: Understand the Setup
- There are **3 teams**.
- Each team has **4 players**.
- Each player shakes hands **3 times** with every member of the opposing teams and **once** with each member of their own team.

### Step 2: Calculate Total Players
The total number of players in the championship can be calculated as:
\[
\text{Total Players} = \text{Number of Teams} \times \text{Players per Team} = 3 \times 4 = 12
\]

### Step 3: Handshakes with Opposing Teams
Each player shakes hands with:
- **3 handshakes** with each member of the opposing teams.
- There are **2 opposing teams** (since a player does not shake hands with their own team).

Thus, the total number of handshakes with opposing teams for one player is:
\[
\text{Handshakes with Opponents} = \text{Number of Opposing Teams} \times \text{Players per Team} \times \text{Handshakes per Opponent} = 2 \times 4 \times 3 = 24
\]

### Step 4: Handshakes with Own Team
Each player shakes hands **once** with each of the other **3 players** on their own team:
\[
\text{Handshakes with Own Team} = 3
\]

### Step 5: Total Handshakes per Player
Now, we can calculate the total handshakes for one player:
\[
\text{Total Handshakes per Player} = \text{Handshakes with Opponents} + \text{Handshakes with Own Team} = 24 + 3 = 27
\]

### Step 6: Total Handshakes in the Championship
To find the total number of handshakes in the championship, we multiply the total handshakes per player by the total number of players:
\[
\text{Total Handshakes} = \text{Total Players} \times \text{Total Handshakes per Player} = 12 \times 27 = 324
\]

### Step 7: Adjust for Double Counting
Since each handshake involves two players, we have counted each handshake twice. Therefore, we need to divide the total by 2:
\[
\text{Final Total Handshakes} = \frac{324}{2} = 162
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of handshakes at the national curling championships is:
\[
\boxed{162}
\]

### Prime Factorization
The prime factors provided were [2, 3, 5, 7]. The number 162 can be factored as:
\[
162 = 2 \times 3^4
\]
This shows that the prime factors of 162 are indeed 2 and 3, but not 5 or 7. Thus, the prime factorization is consistent with the number of handshakes calculated.","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

There are 12 players in total, which offers $12\times27=324$ handshakes, but since a handshake takes place between two people, we've counted every handshake twice.

The final answer is $\dfrac{324}{2}=\boxed{162}$ handshakes.",1,0.015152099999999998

(2\cdot (3\cdot 4)) \cdot (5+1) = 144.
\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).","To solve the problem of how many distinct values can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses, we will follow a systematic approach. 

### Step 1: Understanding the Expression
The original expression is:
\[
2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1
\]
Calculating the multiplication first:
\[
2 \cdot 3 = 6
\]
\[
6 \cdot 4 = 24
\]
\[
24 \cdot 5 = 120
\]
Thus, the expression evaluates to:
\[
120 + 1 = 121
\]

### Step 2: Inserting Parentheses
We need to explore different ways to insert parentheses in the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5\) before adding 1. The goal is to find all distinct results from these variations.

### Step 3: Generating Parentheses Combinations
We can group the terms in various ways. The main combinations can be categorized as follows:

1. **All multiplications grouped**:
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5)\)
   - \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5\)
   - \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5))\)
   - \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)\)

2. **Mixed operations with addition**:
   - \((2 \cdot 3) + (4 \cdot 5)\)
   - \((2 + 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5)\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3) + 4 + 5\)
   - \(2 + (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5))\)
   - \(2 + 3 + (4 \cdot 5)\)

### Step 4: Evaluating Each Combination
Now we will evaluate each of these combinations:

1. \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 6 \cdot 20 = 120\)
2. \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 = (2 \cdot 12) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120\)
3. \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 120\)
4. \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) = 2 \cdot 60 = 120\)
5. \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 120\)

6. \((2 \cdot 3) + (4 \cdot 5) = 6 + 20 = 26\)
7. \((2 + 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 5 \cdot 20 = 100\)
8. \((2 \cdot 3) + 4 + 5 = 6 + 4 + 5 = 15\)
9. \(2 + (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) = 2 + 60 = 62\)
10. \(2 + 3 + (4 \cdot 5) = 2 + 3 + 20 = 25\)

### Step 5: Collecting Distinct Results
Now we collect all distinct results from the evaluations:
- From multiplications: \(120\)
- From mixed operations: \(26, 100, 15, 62, 25\)

Thus, the distinct results are:
\[
\{120, 26, 100, 15, 62, 25\}
\]

### Step 6: Adding 1 to Each Result
Finally, we add 1 to each of these results as per the original expression:
- \(120 + 1 = 121\)
- \(26 + 1 = 27\)
- \(100 + 1 = 101\)
- \(15 + 1 = 16\)
- \(62 + 1 = 63\)
- \(25 + 1 = 26\)

### Final Distinct Values
The final distinct values are:
\[
\{121, 27, 101, 16, 63, 26\}
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of distinct values that can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.
\end{align*}In total there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for the expression.",0,0.019921049999999996
"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To solve the problem of how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we will break down the components and calculate the total combinations step-by-step.

### Step 1: Identify the Components
Tom's Mr. Potato Head has the following features:
- **Hairstyles**: 3 options (plus 1 option for being bald)
- **Eyebrows**: 2 options
- **Eyes**: 1 option
- **Ears**: 2 options
- **Lips**: 2 options
- **Shoes**: 2 options (1 pair of regular shoes + 1 pair of clown shoes)

### Step 2: Calculate the Options for Each Feature
1. **Hairstyles**: 
   - Total options = 3 (hairstyles) + 1 (bald) = 4 options
2. **Eyebrows**: 
   - Total options = 2
3. **Eyes**: 
   - Total options = 1
4. **Ears**: 
   - Total options = 2
5. **Lips**: 
   - Total options = 2
6. **Shoes**: 
   - Total options = 2

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Combinations
To find the total number of different personalities, we multiply the number of options for each feature:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = (\text{Total Hairstyles}) \times (\text{Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Eyes}) \times (\text{Ears}) \times (\text{Lips}) \times (\text{Shoes})
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

### Step 4: Perform the Calculation
Now, we will perform the multiplication step-by-step:

1. \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. \(8 \times 1 = 8\)
3. \(8 \times 2 = 16\)
4. \(16 \times 2 = 32\)
5. \(32 \times 2 = 64\)

Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities Tom can create is:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 64
\]

### Step 5: Verify Against the Target Product Value
The problem states that the target product value is 72, with a prime factorization of \([2, 2, 2, 3, 3]\). However, our calculated total of 64 does not match this target. 

The prime factorization of 64 is \([2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\), which indicates that there is a discrepancy between the expected target product and our calculated result. 

### Conclusion
The calculations for the number of different personalities are correct based on the provided features of Mr. Potato Head. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{64}
\] 

This indicates that Tom can create 64 unique personalities with his Mr. Potato Head, despite the target product value of 72 not aligning with this calculation.","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.013064699999999999
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To solve the problem of counting how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one '0', we can break down the solution step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define the Range
We are interested in whole numbers between 100 and 999 (inclusive). This is because the problem specifies numbers between 99 and 999, and the smallest three-digit number is 100.

### Step 2: Identify the Structure of the Numbers
A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
- \(a\) is the hundreds digit (can be from 1 to 9),
- \(b\) is the tens digit (can be from 0 to 9),
- \(c\) is the units digit (can be from 0 to 9).

### Step 3: Conditions for Exactly One '0'
For a number to contain exactly one '0', we can have the following scenarios:
1. The '0' is in the tens place: \(a0c\)
2. The '0' is in the units place: \(ab0\)

### Step 4: Count Valid Combinations
#### Case 1: '0' in the Tens Place (Form: \(a0c\))
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be '0' to satisfy the condition of having exactly one '0') (9 options).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \times 9 = 81
\]

#### Case 2: '0' in the Units Place (Form: \(ab0\))
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(b\) can be any digit from 0 to 9, but it cannot be '0' (to ensure there's only one '0' in the number). Thus, \(b\) can be from 1 to 9 (9 options).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \times 9 = 81
\]

### Step 5: Combine the Results
Now, we add the results from both cases:
\[
81 + 81 = 162
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of whole numbers between 100 and 999 that contain exactly one '0' is:

\[
\boxed{162}
\] 

This matches the output from the provided code, confirming that the calculations are correct. The prime factors mentioned ([2, 5]) do not directly relate to the counting problem but may refer to the factors of the number 162, which is \(2 \times 81\) or \(2 \times 3^4\). However, they are not necessary for the solution to the counting problem.","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.010139549999999999
