"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","Let's verify the refined solution step by step:

1. **Check if all the given information in the problem is used correctly**:
   - The problem states there are two congruent acute angles and that each of the other three angles equals the sum of the two acute angles. The solution correctly defines \( x \) as the measure of each acute angle and \( 2x \) as the measure of each of the other three angles.

2. **Verify that each step in the solution logically follows from the previous one**:
   - The solution starts with defining the angles, then correctly applies the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon, and sets up the equation based on the angle definitions. Each step logically follows.

3. **Ensure that all calculations are accurate**:
   - The calculation for the sum of the interior angles is correct: \( 540^\circ \).
   - The equation \( 2x + 3(2x) = 540^\circ \) simplifies correctly to \( 8x = 540^\circ \).
   - Solving for \( x \) gives \( x = 67.5^\circ \), which is accurate.
   - The calculation for the large angles \( 2x = 135^\circ \) is also correct.

4. **Confirm that the final answer addresses the specific question asked in the problem**:
   - The final answer states the common measure of the large angles, which is what the problem asks for.

5. **Verify that the final answer is formatted correctly using LaTeX notation enclosed in \(\boxed{}\)**:
   - The final answer is presented as \( \boxed{135} \), which is correctly formatted.

Since all steps are verified to be correct and consistent, the final answer is:

### Step 1: Check Given Information
The elements of the magic square are correctly defined as:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
All elements are used in the calculations.

### Step 2: Verify Logical Flow
The solution logically progresses from defining the elements to calculating the sums of the rows, setting up equations, solving for \( n \), and verifying with column and diagonal sums.

### Step 3: Check Calculations
1. **Row Sums**:
   - Row 1: \( (n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 = 2n + 1 \)
   - Row 2: \( 3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3n - 6 \)
   - Row 3: \( (n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) = 2n + 1 \)

   The calculations for the row sums are correct.

2. **Setting Up Equations**:
   The equation \( 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \) is correctly derived from the row sums.

3. **Solving for \( n \)**:
   Rearranging gives \( n = 7 \), which is correct.

4. **Column Sums**:
   - Column 1: \( (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = 15 \)
   - Column 2: \( (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = 15 \)
   - Column 3: \( 2 + n + (n - 1) = 15 \)

   All column sums equal 15, confirming the calculations.

5. **Diagonal Sums**:
   - Diagonal 1: \( (n - 3) + (2n - 9) + (n - 1) = 15 \)
   - Diagonal 2: \( 2 + (2n - 9) + (n + 1) = 15 \)

   Both diagonal sums also equal 15.

### Step 4: Confirm Final Answer
The final answer \( n = 7 \) is correctly derived and verified through all necessary checks.

### Final Answer
The value of \( n \) is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","Let's verify the refined solution step by step:

### Step 1: Check Given Information
- **Good Worker**: Can paint the house in 12 hours.
- **Bad Worker**: Can paint the house in 36 hours.
- **Time to paint the house**: 3 hours.
- **Number of good workers available**: 3.

All the given information is correctly used in the solution.

### Step 2: Verify Logical Steps
1. The work rates for good and bad workers are defined correctly.
2. The total work done by the good workers is calculated based on their work rate and the time they work.
3. The remaining work is calculated correctly by subtracting the work done by good workers from the total work needed.
4. The equation to find the number of bad workers is set up correctly.

### Step 3: Ensure Calculations are Accurate
- **Work rate of good worker**: 
  \[
  \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
  \]
- **Total work by good workers**:
  \[
  3 \times \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} \times 3 = \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses}
  \]
- **Remaining work**:
  \[
  1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses}
  \]
- **Equation for bad workers**:
  \[
  x \times \frac{1}{36} \times 3 = \frac{1}{4}
  \]
  Simplifying gives:
  \[
  x \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \implies x = 3
  \]

All calculations are accurate.

### Step 4: Confirm Final Answer
The final answer states that 3 bad workers are needed to ensure the house is painted in time.

### Step 5: Format Final Answer
The final answer is correctly formatted in LaTeX notation.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[

Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.
