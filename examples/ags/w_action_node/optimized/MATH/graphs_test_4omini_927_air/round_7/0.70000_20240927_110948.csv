"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","Let's verify the refined solution step by step:

1. **Check if all the given information in the problem is used correctly**:
   - The problem states that there are two congruent acute angles and that each of the other three angles equals the sum of the two acute angles. The solution correctly defines \( x \) as the measure of each acute angle and \( 2x \) as the measure of each of the other three angles.

2. **Verify that each step in the solution logically follows from the previous one**:
   - The solution starts with defining the angles, then correctly applies the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon, and sets up the equation based on the angle definitions. Each step logically follows.

3. **Ensure that all calculations are accurate**:
   - The calculation for the sum of the interior angles is correct: \( 540^\circ \).
   - The equation \( 2x + 3(2x) = 540^\circ \) simplifies correctly to \( 8x = 540^\circ \).
   - Solving for \( x \) gives \( x = 67.5^\circ \), which is accurate.
   - The calculation for the large angles \( 2x = 135^\circ \) is also correct.

4. **Confirm that the final answer addresses the specific question asked in the problem**:
   - The final answer states the common measure of the large angles, which is what the problem asks for.

5. **Verify that the final answer is formatted correctly using LaTeX notation enclosed in \(\boxed{}\)**:
   - The final answer is presented as \( \boxed{135} \), which is correctly formatted.

Since all steps are verified to be correct and consistent, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{135}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[

### Step 1: Check Given Information
The magic square is structured correctly with the values:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
All values are used in the calculations.

### Step 2: Verify Logical Steps
1. **First Row Calculation:**
   \[
   S_1 = (n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
   \]
   This is correct.

2. **Second Row Calculation:**
   \[
   S_2 = 3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
   \]
   This is correct.

3. **Third Row Calculation:**
   \[
   S_3 = (n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
   \]
   This is correct.

### Step 3: Set Up Equations
The equations set up for the rows are:
\[
S_1 = S_2 \implies 2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Rearranging gives:
\[
7 = n
\]

Next, checking \( S_2 = S_3 \):
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Rearranging gives:
\[
n = 7
\]

### Step 4: Verify Columns and Diagonals
1. **First Column:**
   \[
   (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = (7 - 3) + 3 + (7 + 1) = 4 + 3 + 8 = 15
   \]

2. **Second Column:**
   \[
   (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = (7 + 2) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 1 = 9 + 5 + 1 = 15
   \]

3. **Third Column:**
   \[
   2 + n + (n - 1) = 2 + 7 + (7 - 1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
   \]

4. **Main Diagonal:**
   \[
   (n - 3) + (2n - 9) + (n - 1) = (7 - 3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7 - 1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
   \]

5. **Other Diagonal:**
   \[
   2 + (2n - 9) + (n + 1) = 2 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7 + 1) = 2 + 5 + 8 = 15
   \]

### Conclusion
All calculations are correct, and all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to 15 when \( n = 7 \). Therefore, the value of \( n \) is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","Let's verify the refined solution step by step:

### Step 1: Check Given Information
- **Good Worker**: Can paint the house in 12 hours.
- **Bad Worker**: Can paint the house in 36 hours.
- **Time Required**: The house must be painted in 3 hours.
- **Number of Good Workers**: 3.

All the given information is correctly used in the solution.

### Step 2: Verify Logical Steps
1. The work rates for good and bad workers are defined correctly.
2. The total work done by the good workers is calculated based on their work rate and the time they work.
3. The remaining work is calculated correctly by subtracting the work done by good workers from the total work needed.
4. The equation for the number of bad workers needed is set up correctly.

### Step 3: Ensure Calculations are Accurate
- **Work Rate of Good Worker**: 
  \[
  \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
  \]
- **Work Done by 3 Good Workers in 3 Hours**:
  \[
  3 \times \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} \times 3 = \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses}
  \]
- **Remaining Work**:
  \[
  1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses}
  \]
- **Equation for Bad Workers**:
  \[
  x \times \frac{1}{36} \times 3 = \frac{1}{4}
  \]
  Simplifying gives:
  \[
  x \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \implies x = 3
  \]

All calculations are accurate.

### Step 4: Confirm Final Answer
The final answer states that 3 bad workers are needed to ensure the house is painted in 3 hours. This directly addresses the question asked in the problem.

### Step 5: Format Final Answer
The final answer is correctly formatted in LaTeX notation:

### Conclusion
The solution is correct, and the final answer is:

What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","Let's verify the refined solution step by step:

1. **Check if all the given information in the problem is used correctly in the solution.**
   - The problem states that we need to find a common English word with a product value of 715. The solution correctly identifies the letter values and the method for calculating the product value.

2. **Verify that each step in the solution logically follows from the previous one.**
   - The steps logically progress from defining letter values, calculating the product value, factorizing 715, mapping factors to letters, and attempting to form words. However, the conclusion that ""MICE"" has a product value of 715 is incorrect.

3. **Ensure that all calculations are accurate.**
   - The calculations for the product values of ""MICE"" and ""CAGE"" are correct, but they do not match the target product value of 715. The product value of ""MICE"" is \(13 \times 9 \times 3 \times 5 = 585\) and for ""CAGE"" is \(3 \times 1 \times 7 \times 5 = 105\).

4. **Confirm that the final answer addresses the specific question asked in the problem.**
   - The final answer states that the word is ""MICE,"" which does not have a product value of 715. Therefore, it does not address the question correctly.

5. **Verify that the final answer is formatted correctly using LaTeX notation enclosed in \boxed{}.**
   - The final answer is formatted as \(\boxed{MICE}\), but it is incorrect.

### Corrections Needed:
- The solution must find a common English word that has a product value of 715. The factors of 715 are \(5 \times 11 \times 13\), which correspond to the letters E, K, and M. However, we need to explore other combinations or words that could yield a product value of 715.

### Corrected Solution:
After further exploration, we find that the word ""SKIM"" has a product value of:
- S = 19, K = 11, I = 9, M = 13
- Product value = \(19 \times 11 \times 9 \times 13 = 715\).

Thus, the common English word with a product value of 715 is:

\[
\boxed{SKIM}
\]","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}

(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,

Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.

Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"Let's verify the refined solution step by step:

1. **Check if all the given information in the problem is used correctly in the solution**: The problem asks to estimate \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred, and the solution correctly identifies this task.

2. **Verify that each step in the solution logically follows from the previous one**: 
   - The solution starts by calculating \( 14.7923412^2 \), which is the correct first step.
   - It then rounds the result to the nearest hundred, which is the correct next step.

3. **Ensure that all calculations are accurate**: 
   - The calculation of \( 14.7923412^2 \) is incorrect. The correct value is approximately \( 219.999999 \) (as stated), but this is not accurate. The actual calculation yields approximately \( 219.999999 \) when rounded correctly.
   - The square of \( 14.7923412 \) is actually \( 219.999999 \), which is correct, but the rounding step is misleading. The nearest hundred to \( 219.999999 \) is indeed \( 200 \).

4. **Confirm that the final answer addresses the specific question asked in the problem**: The final answer of \( 200 \) does address the question of rounding to the nearest hundred.

5. **Verify that the final answer is formatted correctly using LaTeX notation enclosed in \(\boxed{}\)**: The final answer is correctly formatted as \(\boxed{200}\).

### Conclusion

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","Let's verify the refined solution step by step:

### Step 1: Check Given Information
The problem states that the area of the square is \(49\) square inches. The solution correctly uses this information to find the side length of the square.

### Step 2: Verify Logical Steps
1. The area of the square is calculated correctly:
   \[
   s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
   \]
2. The folding process is correctly described, leading to two congruent right triangles.
3. The leg length of the triangle is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{leg length} = \frac{s}{2} = \frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \text{ inches}
   \]
4. The hypotenuse is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   h = \sqrt{(3.5)^2 + (3.5)^2} = \sqrt{12.25 + 12.25} = \sqrt{24.5}
   \]
   This is correct.

### Step 3: Verify Calculations
- The calculation of the hypotenuse:
  \[
  h = \sqrt{24.5} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 6.125} = 2\sqrt{6.125}
  \]
  This is correct, but we can simplify \(\sqrt{24.5}\) directly:
  \[
  \sqrt{24.5} = \sqrt{\frac{49}{2}} = \frac{7}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}
  \]
  This matches the later calculation.

### Step 4: Confirm Final Answer
The perimeter \(P\) is calculated as:
\[
P = 3.5 + 3.5 + \sqrt{24.5} = 7 + \sqrt{24.5}
\]
Substituting \(\sqrt{24.5}\):
\[
P = 7 + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]
Combining terms:
\[
P = \frac{14}{2} + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{14 + 7\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

### Step 5: Final Answer Formatting
The final answer is correctly formatted in LaTeX notation:
\[
\boxed{\frac{14 + 7\sqrt{2}}{2}}
\]

### Conclusion
The solution is correct, and all steps are logically sound with accurate calculations. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{14 + 7\sqrt{2}}{2}}
\]","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.0180297
