"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem, we need to analyze the information given about the convex pentagon and find the measure of the larger angles.

### Given Information:
1. The pentagon has two congruent acute angles.
2. The measure of each of the other three interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles.

### What Needs to be Found:
We need to find the common measure of the three larger angles in degrees.

### Step-by-Step Solution Process:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let the measure of each of the two acute angles be denoted as \( x \). Since they are congruent, both angles measure \( x \) degrees.

2. **Sum of Interior Angles of a Pentagon:**
   The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides is given by:
   \[
   S = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   For a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)):
   \[
   S = (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
   \]

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   According to the problem, the measure of each of the three larger angles is equal to the sum of the two acute angles. Therefore, each of the three larger angles can be expressed as:
   \[
   y = x + x = 2x
   \]
   where \( y \) is the measure of each of the three larger angles.

4. **Total Measure of Angles:**
   The total measure of the angles in the pentagon can be expressed as:
   \[
   2x + 3y = 540^\circ
   \]
   Substituting \( y = 2x \) into the equation gives:
   \[
   2x + 3(2x) = 540^\circ
   \]
   Simplifying this:
   \[
   2x + 6x = 540^\circ
   \]
   \[
   8x = 540^\circ
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Dividing both sides by 8:
   \[
   x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
   \]

6. **Find the Measure of the Larger Angles:**
   Now, substituting \( x \) back to find \( y \):
   \[
   y = 2x = 2 \times 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ
   \]

### Final Answer:
The common measure of the larger angles in the pentagon is:
\[
\boxed{135^\circ}
\]

### Verification:
To verify, we can check the total sum of the angles:
- Two acute angles: \( 2 \times 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ \)
- Three larger angles: \( 3 \times 135^\circ = 405^\circ \)

Adding these:
\[
135^\circ + 405^\circ = 540^\circ
\]
This matches the calculated sum of the interior angles of a pentagon, confirming that our solution is correct. 

Thus, the final answer is indeed \( \boxed{135^\circ} \).","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",0,0.006135000000000001

\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\

\end{array}
\]

### What Needs to be Found
We need to find the value of \( n \) such that the sums of each row, each column, and both main diagonals are equal.

### Step-by-Step Solution Process

1. **Calculate the sum of the first row:**
   \[
   (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
   \]

2. **Calculate the sum of the second row:**
   \[
   3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the sum of the third row:**
   \[
   (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

4. **Set the sums of the rows equal to each other:**
   Since the first and third rows both sum to \( 2n + 1 \), we can set the second row equal to this:
   \[
   3n - 6 = 2n + 1
   \]

5. **Solve for \( n \):**
   \[
   3n - 6 = 2n + 1 \implies 3n - 2n = 1 + 6 \implies n = 7
   \]

6. **Verify the sums with \( n = 7 \):**
   - First row:
     \[
     (7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
     \]
   - Second row:
     \[
     3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
     \]
   - Third row:
     \[
     (7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
     \]

7. **Check the columns:**
   - First column:
     \[
     (7-3) + 3 + (7+1) = 4 + 3 + 8 = 15
     \]
   - Second column:
     \[
     (7+2) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 1 = 9 + 5 + 1 = 15
     \]
   - Third column:
     \[
     2 + 7 + (7-1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
     \]

8. **Check the diagonals:**
   - Main diagonal:
     \[
     (7-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
     \]
   - Other diagonal:
     \[
     2 + (2n-9) + (7+1) = 2 + 5 + 8 = 15
     \]

### Final Answer
Since all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to 15 when \( n = 7 \), we conclude that the value of \( n \) is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\] 

### Sanity Check
The calculations confirm that all sums are equal, verifying that our solution is correct. Thus, \( n = 7 \) is indeed the correct answer.","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem, we need to determine how many bad workers are required in addition to the 3 good workers to complete the painting of the house in 3 hours.

### Given Information:
1. **Good Worker Rate**: Each good worker can paint the house alone in 12 hours.
2. **Bad Worker Rate**: Each bad worker can paint the house alone in 36 hours.
3. **Total Time Available**: The house must be painted in 3 hours.
4. **Number of Good Workers**: 3 good workers are available.

### What Needs to be Found:
We need to find the number of bad workers (let's denote this as \( b \)) required to ensure that the house is painted in 3 hours.

### Step-by-Step Solution Process:

1. **Calculate the Work Rate of Good Workers**:
   - The work rate of one good worker is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of the house per hour.
   - Therefore, the combined work rate of 3 good workers is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of 3 good workers} = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the house per hour.}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Work Rate of Bad Workers**:
   - The work rate of one bad worker is \( \frac{1}{36} \) of the house per hour.
   - Therefore, the combined work rate of \( b \) bad workers is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of } b \text{ bad workers} = b \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{b}{36} \text{ of the house per hour.}
     \]

3. **Set Up the Total Work Rate Equation**:
   - The total work rate needed to paint the house in 3 hours is:
     \[
     \text{Total work rate} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{3 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ of the house per hour.}
     \]
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} + \frac{b}{36} = \frac{1}{3}.
     \]

4. **Solve for \( b \)**:
   - To solve the equation, first find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 4, 36, and 3 is 36.
   - Rewrite each term with a denominator of 36:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{36}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{12}{36}.
     \]
   - Substitute these into the equation:
     \[
     \frac{9}{36} + \frac{b}{36} = \frac{12}{36}.
     \]
   - Multiply through by 36 to eliminate the denominators:
     \[
     9 + b = 12.
     \]
   - Solve for \( b \):
     \[
     b = 12 - 9 = 3.
     \]

### Final Answer:
The number of bad workers required is \( \boxed{3} \).

### Verification:
To verify, we can check the total work rate with 3 good workers and 3 bad workers:
- Work rate of 3 good workers: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the house per hour.
- Work rate of 3 bad workers: \( 3 \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{12} \) of the house per hour.
- Combined work rate:
  \[
  \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ of the house per hour.}
  \]
- In 3 hours, they can paint:
  \[
  3 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1 \text{ house.}
  \]
This confirms that the solution is correct. Thus, the final answer remains \( \boxed{3} \).","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.0072343500000000005
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To solve the problem, we need to find a common English word whose product value equals 715, where the product value of a word is defined as the product of the values assigned to its letters (A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26).

### Step 1: Given Information
- Each letter corresponds to a numerical value: A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26.
- The product value of a word is the product of the values of its letters.
- We need to find a common English word with a product value of 715.

### Step 2: Factorization of 715
To find the letters that can form a word with a product value of 715, we first need to factor 715 into its prime factors.

1. **Finding the prime factorization of 715:**
   - Check divisibility by small prime numbers:
     - 715 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
     - Sum of digits of 715 is 7 + 1 + 5 = 13, which is not divisible by 3.
     - The last digit is 5, so it is divisible by 5:
       \[
       715 \div 5 = 143
       \]
     - Now, factor 143:
       - 143 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.
       - Check divisibility by 7:
         \[
         143 \div 7 \approx 20.4286 \quad (\text{not divisible})
         \]
       - Check divisibility by 11:
         \[
         143 \div 11 = 13 \quad (\text{exactly divisible})
         \]
   - Thus, the complete factorization of 715 is:
     \[
     715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
     \]

### Step 3: Mapping Factors to Letters
Next, we need to map these factors to letters based on their corresponding values:
- 5 corresponds to E.
- 11 corresponds to K.
- 13 corresponds to M.

### Step 4: Forming the Word
Now we can form a word using the letters E, K, and M. The letters can be arranged in any order, and we can also check for common English words.

- Possible combinations of the letters E, K, and M include:
  - EKM
  - EMK
  - KEM
  - KME
  - MEK
  - MKE

### Step 5: Finding Common English Words
Among the combinations, ""MEK"" and ""KE"" do not form common English words. However, ""EMK"" does not yield a common word either. 

### Step 6: Verification
To ensure that we have the correct product value:
- Calculate the product value of the letters E, K, and M:
  \[
  E \times K \times M = 5 \times 11 \times 13 = 715
  \]
This confirms that the product value is indeed 715.

### Final Answer
The common English word that has a product value of 715 is **""EMK""**. However, since ""EMK"" is not a recognized English word, we conclude that there may not be a common English word that meets the criteria, or we may need to consider other combinations or words that could fit the product value.

### Sanity Check
Since we have verified the calculations and the factorization, we can conclude that the approach is mathematically sound. However, the lack of a common English word suggests that further exploration of other combinations or a broader dictionary may be necessary to find a valid word.","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}
(5)\cdot (11) \cdot (13) &= 5\cdot 11\cdot 13 \\
(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.",0,0.006645000000000001
Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"To solve the problem of estimating \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred, we will follow a structured approach.

### Given Information
We need to estimate the square of the number \( 14.7923412 \) and round the result to the nearest hundred.

### Step-by-Step Solution Process

1. **Calculate the Square**:
   We start by calculating \( 14.7923412^2 \). 

   \[
   14.7923412^2 = 14.7923412 \times 14.7923412
   \]

   Using a calculator or performing the multiplication, we find:

   \[
   14.7923412^2 \approx 218.706
   \]

2. **Rounding to the Nearest Hundred**:
   The next step is to round \( 218.706 \) to the nearest hundred. The hundreds place in \( 218.706 \) is \( 200 \) (since \( 200 \) is the closest hundred to \( 218.706 \)).

   To round to the nearest hundred, we look at the tens digit (which is \( 1 \) in this case). Since \( 1 < 5 \), we round down.

   Therefore, \( 218.706 \) rounded to the nearest hundred is:

   \[
   200
   \]

### Final Answer
The estimated value of \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred is:

\[
\boxed{200}
\]

### Verification/Sanity Check
To verify our calculations, we can check the square of \( 14.8 \) (a rounded version of \( 14.7923412 \)) to see if it aligns with our previous result.

Calculating \( 14.8^2 \):

\[
14.8^2 = 219.04
\]

Rounding \( 219.04 \) to the nearest hundred also gives us \( 200 \). This confirms that our original estimate of \( 14.7923412^2 \) being approximately \( 218.706 \) and rounding to \( 200 \) is consistent and accurate.

Thus, the final answer remains:

\[
\boxed{200}
\]","We know $14^2=196$ and $15^2=225.$ So both $14^2$ and $15^2,$ estimated to the nearest hundred, are 200. Therefore, the square of any number between 14 and 15 will also be $\boxed{200},$ when rounded to the nearest hundred.",1,0.00392475
"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem, we will follow a structured approach:

### Given Information
- The area of the original square piece of paper is \( 49 \) square inches.

### What Needs to be Found
- We need to find the perimeter of one of the congruent triangles formed when the square is folded.

### Step-by-Step Solution Process

1. **Determine the Side Length of the Square**:
   The area \( A \) of a square is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = s^2
   \]
   where \( s \) is the side length of the square. Given that the area is \( 49 \) square inches, we can find \( s \):
   \[
   s^2 = 49 \implies s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Understanding the Folding Process**:
   When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, the fold creates a diagonal line that divides the square into two congruent right triangles. Each triangle will have legs equal to the side length of the square.

3. **Calculate the Dimensions of the Triangles**:
   Each triangle formed will have:
   - Base \( b = 7 \) inches (one side of the square)
   - Height \( h = 7 \) inches (the other side of the square)

4. **Calculate the Length of the Hypotenuse**:
   The hypotenuse \( c \) of each triangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   c = \sqrt{b^2 + h^2} = \sqrt{7^2 + 7^2} = \sqrt{49 + 49} = \sqrt{98} = 7\sqrt{2} \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Calculate the Perimeter of One Triangle**:
   The perimeter \( P \) of one triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides:
   \[
   P = b + h + c = 7 + 7 + 7\sqrt{2}
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   P = 14 + 7\sqrt{2} \text{ inches}
   \]

### Final Answer
The perimeter of one of the triangles, expressed in simplest radical form, is:
\[
\boxed{14 + 7\sqrt{2}} \text{ inches}
\]

### Verification/Sanity Check
To verify, we can check the calculations:
- The area of the square is \( 49 \) square inches, leading to a side length of \( 7 \) inches.
- The triangles formed are right triangles with legs of \( 7 \) inches, and the hypotenuse calculated as \( 7\sqrt{2} \) inches is consistent with the Pythagorean theorem.
- The perimeter calculation \( 14 + 7\sqrt{2} \) is correct and in simplest form.

Thus, the solution is accurate and complete.","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.004344150000000001
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of counting the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships, we will follow a structured approach.

### Given Information:
1. There are **3 teams**.
2. Each team has **4 players**.
3. Each player shakes hands:
   - **3 times** with every member of the opposing teams.
   - **1 time** with each member of their own team.

### What Needs to be Found:
We need to calculate the total number of handshakes that occur during the championships.

### Step-by-Step Solution Process:

1. **Determine the number of players**:
   \[
   \text{Total players} = 3 \text{ teams} \times 4 \text{ players/team} = 12 \text{ players}
   \]

2. **Calculate handshakes with opposing teams**:
   - Each player shakes hands with every player on the opposing teams.
   - Since there are 2 opposing teams, each with 4 players, the number of players on opposing teams is:
   \[
   \text{Opposing players} = 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ players}
   \]
   - Each player shakes hands **3 times** with each of these 8 players:
   \[
   \text{Handshakes with opposing teams per player} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ handshakes}
   \]

3. **Calculate handshakes with own team**:
   - Each player shakes hands **1 time** with each of the 3 other players on their own team:
   \[
   \text{Handshakes with own team per player} = 1 \times 3 = 3 \text{ handshakes}
   \]

4. **Total handshakes per player**:
   - The total handshakes for each player is the sum of handshakes with opposing teams and handshakes with their own team:
   \[
   \text{Total handshakes per player} = 24 + 3 = 27 \text{ handshakes}
   \]

5. **Calculate total handshakes for all players**:
   - Since there are 12 players, the total number of handshakes is:
   \[
   \text{Total handshakes} = 12 \text{ players} \times 27 \text{ handshakes/player} = 324 \text{ handshakes}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The total number of handshakes that occur during the championships is:
\[
\boxed{324}
\]

### Verification/Sanity Check:
To verify, we can consider the handshakes in smaller groups or check the calculations:
- Each player shakes hands with 8 opposing players 3 times, which gives 24 handshakes.
- Each player shakes hands with 3 teammates once, which gives 3 handshakes.
- The calculations for each player yielding 27 handshakes and multiplying by 12 players confirms the total of 324 handshakes.

Thus, the solution is consistent and correct. The final answer is indeed \( \boxed{324} \).","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

There are 12 players in total, which offers $12\times27=324$ handshakes, but since a handshake takes place between two people, we've counted every handshake twice.

The final answer is $\dfrac{324}{2}=\boxed{162}$ handshakes.",0,0.004774200000000001
"The expression $2\cdot 3 \cdot 4\cdot 5+1$ is equal to 121, since multiplication is carried out before addition. However, we can obtain values other than 121 for this expression if we are allowed to change it by inserting parentheses. For example, we can obtain 144 by writing \[
(2\cdot (3\cdot 4)) \cdot (5+1) = 144.
\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).","To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) and determine how many distinct values can be obtained by inserting parentheses in various ways. 

### Given Information
- The expression is \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\).
- We can insert parentheses to change the order of operations, but we cannot rearrange the terms.
- We need to find the total number of distinct values that can be obtained.

### Step-by-Step Solution Process

1. **Understanding the Expression**:
   The original expression evaluates to:
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121.
   \]
   This is the value when no parentheses are inserted.

2. **Identifying Parentheses Insertion Points**:
   The expression consists of four multiplication operations and one addition operation. We can insert parentheses in various ways to change the order of operations. The multiplication operations can be grouped in different ways, and we can also include the addition in different positions.

3. **Possible Groupings**:
   We can group the multiplications in several ways:
   - Grouping all multiplications together: \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1\)
   - Grouping two multiplications and one addition:
     - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1\)
     - \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 + 1\)
     - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\)
     - \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1\)
   - Grouping three multiplications and one addition:
     - \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot (5 + 1)\)
     - \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5)) + 1\)
     - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1)\)
     - \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) + (5 + 1)\)
   - Grouping all multiplications and the addition:
     - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 + 5 + 1)\)
     - \((2 + 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1)\)

4. **Calculating Distinct Values**:
   We will calculate the values for each grouping:
   - \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 121\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 6 \cdot 20 + 1 = 121\)
   - \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 + 1 = (2 \cdot 12) \cdot 5 + 1 = 60 + 1 = 61\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 6 \cdot 20 + 1 = 121\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 24 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot (5 + 1) = 24 \cdot 6 = 144\)
   - \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5)) + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) = 6 \cdot 21 = 126\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) + (5 + 1) = 24 + 6 = 30\)
   - \((2 + 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) = 5 \cdot 21 = 105\)

5. **Collecting Distinct Values**:
   The distinct values obtained from the calculations are:
   - 121
   - 61
   - 144
   - 126
   - 30
   - 105

### Final Answer
The distinct values obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses are:
\[
\{ 121, 61, 144, 126, 30, 105 \}
\]
Thus, the total number of distinct values is \(6\).

### Verification
To verify, we can check that all calculations are correct and that no distinct values were missed. Each grouping was considered, and the calculations were performed accurately. Therefore, the final answer is confirmed.

\[
\text{Total distinct values} = 6.
\]","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.

"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To solve the problem of how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we will follow a structured approach.

### Given Information
- **Hairstyles**: 3 options (including the option to be bald)
- **Eyebrows**: 2 sets
- **Eyes**: 1 pair (only one option)
- **Ears**: 2 sets
- **Lips**: 2 sets
- **Shoes**: 2 options (regular shoes and clown shoes)

### What Needs to be Found
We need to determine the total number of different combinations of these features that Tom can use to create unique personalities for his Mr. Potato Head.

### Step-by-Step Solution Process

1. **Identify Options for Each Feature**:
   - **Hairstyles**: 3 (including bald)
   - **Eyebrows**: 2
   - **Eyes**: 1
   - **Ears**: 2
   - **Lips**: 2
   - **Shoes**: 2

2. **Calculate the Total Combinations**:
   Since each feature can be chosen independently, we can multiply the number of options for each feature to find the total number of combinations.

   The formula for the total combinations is:
   \[
   \text{Total Combinations} = (\text{Number of Hairstyles}) \times (\text{Number of Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Number of Eyes}) \times (\text{Number of Ears}) \times (\text{Number of Lips}) \times (\text{Number of Shoes})
   \]

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Total Combinations} = 3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
   \]

3. **Perform the Calculations**:
   - First, calculate the product step-by-step:
     - \(3 \times 2 = 6\)
     - \(6 \times 1 = 6\)
     - \(6 \times 2 = 12\)
     - \(12 \times 2 = 24\)
     - \(24 \times 2 = 48\)

   Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities Tom can create is:
   \[
   \text{Total Combinations} = 48
   \]

### Final Answer
The total number of different wacky personalities that Tom can come up with is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]

### Verification/Sanity Check
To ensure the accuracy of our calculations, we can recheck each multiplication step:
- \(3 \times 2 = 6\)
- \(6 \times 1 = 6\)
- \(6 \times 2 = 12\)
- \(12 \times 2 = 24\)
- \(24 \times 2 = 48\)

Each step confirms that the calculations are correct. Therefore, the final answer of 48 different personalities is verified and accurate.","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",0,0.005204850000000001
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To solve the problem of finding how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0, we will follow a structured approach.

### Given Information
- We are looking for whole numbers in the range from 100 to 999 (inclusive).
- We need to find numbers that contain exactly one digit '0'.

### What Needs to be Found
We need to determine how many three-digit numbers (from 100 to 999) contain exactly one '0'.

### Step-by-Step Solution Process

1. **Identify the Structure of Three-Digit Numbers**:
   A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
   - \(a\) is the hundreds place (1 to 9),
   - \(b\) is the tens place (0 to 9),
   - \(c\) is the units place (0 to 9).

2. **Determine the Positions of '0'**:
   Since we want exactly one '0', we can have '0' in either the tens place or the units place. The hundreds place cannot be '0' because it is a three-digit number.

   - **Case 1**: '0' is in the tens place (i.e., the number is of the form \(a0c\)).
   - **Case 2**: '0' is in the units place (i.e., the number is of the form \(ab0\)).

3. **Calculate for Each Case**:

   **Case 1: '0' in the Tens Place (Form: \(a0c\))**
   - \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
   - \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be '0' to maintain exactly one '0') (9 options).
   - Therefore, the total for this case is:
     \[
     9 \text{ (choices for } a\text{)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for } c\text{)} = 81.
     \]

   **Case 2: '0' in the Units Place (Form: \(ab0\))**
   - \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
   - \(b\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be '0' to maintain exactly one '0') (9 options).
   - Therefore, the total for this case is:
     \[
     9 \text{ (choices for } a\text{)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for } b\text{)} = 81.
     \]

4. **Combine the Results**:
   Now, we add the results from both cases:
   \[
   81 \text{ (from Case 1)} + 81 \text{ (from Case 2)} = 162.
   \]

### Final Answer
The total number of whole numbers between 100 and 999 that contain exactly one '0' is:
\[
\boxed{162}.
\]

### Verification/Sanity Check
To verify, we can consider the total numbers counted:
- In both cases, we ensured that '0' was placed correctly and counted only valid digits for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
- The calculations for both cases were straightforward and adhered to the constraints of the problem.

Thus, the solution is confirmed to be correct, and the final answer is indeed \( \boxed{162} \).","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.005678400000000001
