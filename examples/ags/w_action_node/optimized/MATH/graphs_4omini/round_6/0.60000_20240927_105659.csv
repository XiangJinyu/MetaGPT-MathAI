"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To provide a corrected and improved solution to the problem of finding the common measure of the large angles in a particular convex pentagon with two congruent acute angles, we will follow a clear, step-by-step approach, addressing all issues mentioned in the verification result.

### Step 1: Define the Angles
Let \( x \) be the measure of each of the two congruent acute angles. According to the problem, the measure of each of the other three angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. Therefore, each of the larger angles can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Large angle} = 2x
\]

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180
\]
For a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)):
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180 = 3 \times 180 = 540 \text{ degrees}
\]

Now, we can set up the equation based on the angles we defined:
\[
2x + 3(2x) = 540
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 6x = 540
\]
\[
8x = 540
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
Now, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{540}{8} = 67.5 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 4: Find the Measure of the Large Angles
Now that we have \( x \), we can find the measure of each of the large angles:
\[
\text{Large angle} = 2x = 2 \times 67.5 = 135 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 5: Verify the Conditions
1. **Acute Angles**: Since \( x = 67.5 \) degrees, the acute angles are indeed acute.
2. **Large Angles**: Each large angle is \( 135 \) degrees, which is less than \( 180 \) degrees, confirming that the angles are valid for a convex pentagon.

### Final Answer
Thus, the common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.025525799999999987

[/asy]","To solve for the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sums of each row, column, and diagonal are equal. Let's go through the calculations step by step.

### Step 1: Define the Elements of the Magic Square

The magic square is defined as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Row Sums

1. **Row 1**:
   \[
   (n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
   \]

2. **Row 2**:
   \[
   3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
   \]

3. **Row 3**:
   \[
   (n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1

   \]

3. **Column 3**:
   \[
   2 + n + (n - 1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Diagonal Sums

1. **Diagonal 1** (from top-left to bottom-right):
   \[
   (n - 3) + (2n - 9) + (n - 1) = n - 3 + 2n - 9 + n - 1 = 4n - 13

### Step 5: Set Up the Equations

Since the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals must be equal, we can set up the following equations:

1. From Row 1 and Row 2:
   \[
   2n + 1 = 3n - 6
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   6 + 1 = 3n - 2n \implies n = 7
   \]

2. From Row 1 and Row 3 (which are equal):
   \[
   2n + 1 = 2n + 1 \quad \text{(always true)}

### Conclusion

The consistent value of \( n \) across all equations is \( 7 \). Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To determine how many bad workers are needed to paint the house in 3 hours alongside 3 good workers, we will follow a systematic approach to ensure all calculations are accurate.

### Step 1: Determine Work Rates

1. **Good Workers**:
   - Each good worker can paint the house in 12 hours.
   - Therefore, the work done by one good worker in one hour is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of one good worker} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ of the house per hour}
     \]
   - With 3 good workers, the total work done by them in one hour is:
     \[
     \text{Total work by good workers in one hour} = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the house}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate Work Done by Good Workers in 3 Hours

- In 3 hours, the total work done by the 3 good workers is:
  \[
  \text{Total work by good workers in 3 hours} = 3 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ of the house}
  \]

### Step 3: Determine Remaining Work

- The total work needed to paint the house is 1 (the whole house).
- The remaining work after the good workers have contributed is:
  \[
  \text{Remaining work} = 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the house}
  \]

### Step 4: Work Rate of Bad Workers

1. **Bad Workers**:
   - Each bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours.
   - Therefore, the work done by one bad worker in one hour is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of one bad worker} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ of the house per hour}
     \]
   - In 3 hours, the total work done by one bad worker is:
     \[
     \text{Total work by one bad worker in 3 hours} = 3 \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ of the house}
     \]

### Step 5: Calculate Number of Bad Workers Needed

- Let \( n \) be the number of bad workers needed. The total work done by \( n \) bad workers in 3 hours is:
  \[
  n \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{n}{12} \text{ of the house}
  \]
- We need this to equal the remaining work:
  \[
  \frac{n}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
  \]
- Solving for \( n \):
  \[
  n = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
  \]

### Conclusion

Thus, the correct number of bad workers needed to ensure the house is painted in 3 hours, alongside the 3 good workers, is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.02486504999999999
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To find a common English word with a product value of 715, we will follow a systematic approach, addressing the issues identified in the verification result. 

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding the Product Value**: 
   The product value of a word is calculated by multiplying the values assigned to each letter, where A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26. For example, the word ""CAB"" has a product value of \(3 \times 1 \times 2 = 6\).

2. **Factoring 715**: 
   We start by finding the prime factorization of 715:
   \[
   715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
   \]
   This corresponds to the letters:
   - E (5)
   - K (11)
   - M (13)

3. **Exploring Combinations**: 
   We need to explore combinations of letters that can yield a product value of 715. The letters corresponding to the factors we found are E, K, and M. However, we should also consider other combinations of letters that could yield the same product.

4. **Generating Possible Words**: 
   We will check a more extensive list of common English words to see if any of them have a product value of 715. 

### Implementation

To implement this, we can define functions to calculate the letter values and the product value of a word. We will also create a more comprehensive list of common English words.

#### Python Implementation

```python
def letter_value(letter):
    """"""Return the value of a letter based on its position in the alphabet.""""""
    return ord(letter.upper()) - ord('A') + 1

def product_value(word):

        product *= letter_value(letter)
    return product

        ""MICE"", ""CAGE"", ""BEE"", ""CAB"", ""DOG"", ""CAT"", ""BAD"", ""GOOD"", ""HAT"", ""BAT"", 
        ""FISH"", ""FACE"", ""BEEHIVE"", ""ACE"", ""BADGE"", ""FAD"", ""DEED"", ""MOM"", ""ME"", 
        ""MEK"", ""KEM"", ""KEME"", ""MEAL"", ""MEET"", ""KEME"", ""KEM"", ""MEEK"", ""MEKE"", ""KEME""
    ]

def find_word_with_product(target_product):
    """"""Find and return the common English word with a product value of target_product.""""""
    words = common_english_words()
    
    # Check each word to see if its product value matches the target
    for word in words:
        if product_value(word) == target_product:
            return word  # Return the first matching word
    
    return None  # Return None if no word matches

# Target product value
target_product = 715
result = find_word_with_product(target_product)
result
```

### Conclusion

After running the above code, we can check if any common English word has a product value of 715. 

Upon checking the combinations, we find that the word ""MEAL"" (M=13, E=5, A=1, L=12) has a product value of:
\[
13 \times 5 \times 1 \times 12 = 780 \quad \text{(not valid)}
\]
However, the word ""KEG"" (K=11, E=5, G=7) has a product value of:
\[
11 \times 5 \times 7 = 385 \quad \text{(not valid)}
\]
After checking various combinations, we find that the word ""MEG"" (M=13, E=5, G=7) has a product value of:
\[
13 \times 5 \times 7 = 455 \quad \text{(not valid)}
\]
Finally, we find that the word ""MEK"" (M=13, E=5, K=11) has a product value of:
\[
13 \times 5 \times 11 = 715
\]

However, since ""MEK"" is not a common English word, we need to check further. 

After extensive checking, we find that the word ""BEE"" (B=2, E=5, E=5) has a product value of:
\[
2 \times 5 \times 5 = 50 \quad \text{(not valid)}
\]

After checking various combinations, we find that the word ""KEM"" (K=11, E=5, M=13) has a product value of:
\[
11 \times 5 \times 13 = 715
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{KEM}}
\] 

If no word is found, we may need to expand our dictionary further or consider combinations of letters that yield the product value of 715.","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}

(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.",0,0.03570119999999999

To round \( 218.8 \) to the nearest hundred, we consider the following:

- The hundreds place in \( 218.8 \) is \( 200 \).
- The next hundred is \( 300 \).
- Since \( 218.8 \) is closer to \( 200 \) than to \( 300 \), we round down to \( 200 \).

\[
\boxed{200}

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem step-by-step, we will follow the correct reasoning and calculations based on the given area of the square and the properties of the triangles formed when the square is folded.

### Step 1: Calculate the Side Length of the Square
The area of the square is given as \(49\) square inches. The side length \(s\) of the square can be calculated as follows:
\[
s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Understand the Folding Process
When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, it creates two congruent right triangles. The legs of these triangles are equal to the side length of the square.

### Step 3: Calculate the Legs of the Triangle
The legs of the triangle formed by the fold are:
\[
\text{leg length} = s = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Hypotenuse
Using the Pythagorean theorem, the hypotenuse \(h\) of the triangle can be calculated as follows:
\[
h = \sqrt{(\text{leg length})^2 + (\text{leg length})^2} = \sqrt{7^2 + 7^2} = \sqrt{49 + 49} = \sqrt{98} = 7\sqrt{2} \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Perimeter of One Triangle
The perimeter \(P\) of one of the triangles is the sum of the lengths of its three sides:
\[
P = \text{leg length} + \text{leg length} + \text{hypotenuse} = 7 + 7 + 7\sqrt{2} = 14 + 7\sqrt{2} \text{ inches}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles, expressed in simplest radical form, is:
\[
\boxed{14 + 7\sqrt{2}}
\]","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.02184209999999999
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of calculating the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships, we will follow a structured approach, ensuring clarity and accuracy in each step.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Identify the Number of Teams and Players**:
   - There are 3 teams.
   - Each team consists of 4 players.

2. **Calculate the Total Number of Players**:
   \[
   \text{Total Players} = \text{Number of Teams} \times \text{Players per Team} = 3 \times 4 = 12
   \]

3. **Handshakes with Own Team**:
   - Each player shakes hands with every other member of their own team. Since there are 4 players on a team, each player shakes hands with \(4 - 1 = 3\) other players.
   - The total number of handshakes within one team can be calculated using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \), where \( n \) is the number of players in the team. For 4 players:
   \[
   \text{Handshakes within one team} = \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
   \]
   - Since there are 3 teams, the total handshakes within all teams is:
   \[
   \text{Total Handshakes with Own Team} = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

4. **Handshakes with Opposing Teams**:
   - Each player shakes hands three times with every member of the opposing teams. There are 2 opposing teams, each with 4 players, giving a total of \(4 + 4 = 8\) opposing players.
   \[
   \text{Handshakes with Opposing Teams} = 8 \times 3 = 24
   \]

5. **Total Handshakes per Player**:
   - The total number of handshakes for each player is the sum of handshakes with their own team and handshakes with opposing teams.
   \[
   \text{Total Handshakes per Player} = \text{Handshakes with Own Team} + \text{Handshakes with Opposing Teams} = 6 + 24 = 30
   \]

6. **Total Handshakes for All Players**:
   - To find the total number of handshakes for all players, multiply the total handshakes per player by the total number of players.
   \[
   \text{Total Handshakes} = \text{Total Handshakes per Player} \times \text{Total Players} = 30 \times 12 = 360
   \]

### Final Answer
Thus, the corrected total number of handshakes at the national curling championships is:

\[
\boxed{360}

   - \((3 \cdot (2 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5\)
   - \((4 \cdot (2 \cdot 3)) \cdot 5\)

### Step 4: Calculating Distinct Products
Now we will calculate the products for each of these groupings:

1. **Single Grouping**:
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 120
   \]

2. **Double Groupings**:
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 6 \cdot 20 = 120\)
   - \((2 \cdot 4) \cdot (3 \cdot 5) = 8 \cdot 15 = 120\)
   - \((2 \cdot 5) \cdot (3 \cdot 4) = 10 \cdot 12 = 120\)
   - \((3 \cdot 4) \cdot (2 \cdot 5) = 12 \cdot 10 = 120\)
   - \((3 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 4) = 15 \cdot 8 = 120\)
   - \((4 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 3) = 20 \cdot 6 = 120\)

3. **Triple Groupings**:
   - \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 = (2 \cdot 12) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120\)
   - \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 5)) \cdot 4 = (2 \cdot 15) \cdot 4 = 30 \cdot 4 = 120\)
   - \((2 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) \cdot 3 = (2 \cdot 20) \cdot 3 = 40 \cdot 3 = 120\)
   - \((3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) \cdot 2 = (3 \cdot 20) \cdot 2 = 60 \cdot 2 = 120\)
   - \((3 \cdot (2 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 = (3 \cdot 8) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120\)
   - \((4 \cdot (2 \cdot 3)) \cdot 5 = (4 \cdot 6) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120\)

### Step 5: Collecting Distinct Products
From all the calculations, we see that all groupings yield the same product of \(120\). Therefore, the only product we can obtain from the multiplication is \(120\).

### Step 6: Final Calculation
Now, we add 1 to the distinct product:
\[
120 + 1 = 121
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of distinct values that can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\] 

This indicates that there is only one distinct value obtainable from the expression by varying the placement of parentheses.","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.
\end{align*}In total there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for the expression.",0,0.02790884999999999
"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To determine the total number of different wacky personalities that Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we need to consider the various options available for each feature. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Identify the Options for Each Feature

1. **Hairstyles**: There are 3 different hairstyles available. Additionally, Mr. Potato Head can be bald, which adds 1 more option.
   - Total hair options = 3 (hairstyles) + 1 (bald) = 4

2. **Eyebrows**: There are 2 sets of eyebrows.
   - Total eyebrow options = 2

3. **Eyes**: There is 1 pair of googly eyes.
   - Total eye options = 1

4. **Ears**: There are 2 sets of ears.
   - Total ear options = 2

5. **Lips**: There are 2 sets of lips.
   - Total lip options = 2

6. **Shoes**: There are 2 options for shoes (1 pair of regular shoes and 1 pair of clown shoes).
   - Total shoe options = 2

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Combinations

To find the total number of different personalities, we multiply the number of options for each feature together. The formula for the total combinations is:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = (\text{Total Hair Options}) \times (\text{Total Eyebrow Options}) \times (\text{Total Eye Options}) \times (\text{Total Ear Options}) \times (\text{Total Lip Options}) \times (\text{Total Shoe Options})
\]

Substituting the values we identified:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = (4) \times (2) \times (1) \times (2) \times (2) \times (2)
\]

### Step 3: Perform the Calculations

Now, we will perform the multiplication step-by-step:

1. Calculate the hair and eyebrow options:
   \[
   4 \times 2 = 8
   \]

2. Multiply by the eye options:
   \[
   8 \times 1 = 8
   \]

3. Multiply by the ear options:
   \[
   8 \times 2 = 16
   \]

4. Multiply by the lip options:
   \[
   16 \times 2 = 32
   \]

5. Finally, multiply by the shoe options:
   \[
   32 \times 2 = 64
   \]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities that Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head is:

\[
\boxed{64}
\]","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.015273299999999997
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To solve the problem of finding how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one '0', we can break down the solution step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define the Range
We are interested in whole numbers between 100 and 999, as these are the three-digit numbers. The range of numbers we will consider is from 100 to 999 inclusive.

### Step 2: Identify the Structure of Three-Digit Numbers
A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
- \(a\) is the hundreds digit (can be from 1 to 9),
- \(b\) is the tens digit (can be from 0 to 9),
- \(c\) is the units digit (can be from 0 to 9).

### Step 3: Conditions for Exactly One '0'
For a number to contain exactly one '0', we can have the following scenarios:
1. The '0' is in the tens place (\(a0c\)).
2. The '0' is in the units place (\(ab0\)).

### Step 4: Count Valid Combinations

#### Case 1: '0' in the Tens Place (\(a0c\))
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be '0' to ensure exactly one '0') (9 options).

Thus, the total combinations for this case are:
\[
9 \text{ (choices for } a\text{)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for } c\text{)} = 81
\]

#### Case 2: '0' in the Units Place (\(ab0\))
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(b\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be '0' to ensure exactly one '0') (9 options).

Thus, the total combinations for this case are:
\[
9 \text{ (choices for } a\text{)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for } b\text{)} = 81
\]

### Step 5: Total Count
Now, we add the counts from both cases:
\[
81 \text{ (from case 1)} + 81 \text{ (from case 2)} = 162
\]

### Final Answer
The total number of whole numbers between 99 and 999 that contain exactly one '0' is:
\[
\boxed{162}
\]","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.015842849999999995
