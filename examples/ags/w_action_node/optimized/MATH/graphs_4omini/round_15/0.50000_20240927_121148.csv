"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem regarding the angles of a convex pentagon, we will follow a structured approach. 

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
We have a convex pentagon with:
- Two congruent acute angles.
- The measure of each of the other three angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles.

### Step 2: Setting Up the Variables
Let:
- \( x \) be the measure of each acute angle.
- Since there are two acute angles, their total measure is \( 2x \).
- The measure of each of the three larger angles is equal to the sum of the two acute angles, which is also \( 2x \).

### Step 3: Sum of Interior Angles of a Pentagon
The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = (n - 2) \times 180
\]
where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)):
\[
\text{Sum} = (5 - 2) \times 180 = 3 \times 180 = 540 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 4: Setting Up the Equation
The total measure of the angles in the pentagon can be expressed as:
\[
2x + 3(2x) = 540
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 6x = 540
\]
\[
8x = 540
\]

### Step 5: Solving for \( x \)
Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{540}{8} = 67.5 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 6: Finding the Measure of the Larger Angles
The measure of each larger angle is:
\[
2x = 2 \times 67.5 = 135 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 7: Verifying the Problem Statement
The problem states that the common measure of the larger angles is given as 108 degrees. However, based on our calculations, we found that the larger angles measure 135 degrees. This indicates a discrepancy.

### Step 8: Conclusion
The calculations show that the common measure of the larger angles, based on the given conditions, is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]

### Step 9: Prime Factorization of 135
To find the prime factorization of 135:
1. Start with \( 135 \):
   - \( 135 = 3 \times 45 \)
   - \( 45 = 3 \times 15 \)
   - \( 15 = 3 \times 5 \)
   
Thus, the prime factorization of 135 is:
\[
135 = 3^3 \times 5^1
\]

### Final Summary
- The common measure of the larger angles is \( \boxed{135} \).
- The prime factorization of 135 is \( 3^3 \times 5^1 \).","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.019934250000000008

label(""$n-1$"",(2.5,2.5));
[/asy]","To solve the problem of finding the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we will follow a systematic approach. 

### Step 1: Define the Elements of the Magic Square

The magic square is defined as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Sums of Each Row

1. **Row 1**: 
   \[
   (n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 = 2n + 1
   \]

2. **Row 2**: 
   \[
   3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3n - 6
   \]

3. **Row 3**: 
   \[
   (n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) = 2n + 1
   \]

### Step 3: Set the Sums Equal to Each Other

Since this is a magic square, the sums of each row must be equal. We can set the sums of Row 1 and Row 2 equal to each other:

\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
2n + 1 + 6 = 3n \implies 7 = n
\]

### Step 4: Verify the Value of \( n \)

Now, we will verify that \( n = 7 \) satisfies the conditions of the magic square by checking the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals.

1. **Substituting \( n = 7 \)**:
   - Row 1: 
     \[
     (7 - 3) + (7 + 2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
     \]
   - Row 2: 
     \[
     3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
     \]
   - Row 3: 
     \[
     (7 + 1) + 1 + (7 - 1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
     \]

2. **Calculating the Columns**:
   - Column 1: 
     \[
     (7 - 3) + 3 + (7 + 1) = 4 + 3 + 8 = 15
     \]
   - Column 2: 
     \[
     (7 + 2) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 1 = 9 + 5 + 1 = 15
     \]
   - Column 3: 
     \[
     2 + 7 + (7 - 1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
     \]

3. **Calculating the Diagonals**:
   - Diagonal 1: 
     \[
     (7 - 3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7 - 1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
     \]
   - Diagonal 2: 
     \[
     2 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7 + 1) = 2 + 5 + 8 = 15
     \]

### Conclusion

Since all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to 15, the value of \( n \) that satisfies the conditions of the magic square is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem of how many bad workers are needed to paint the house in 3 hours, given that good workers can paint the house in 12 hours and bad workers can do it in 36 hours, we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the Work Rate of Each Worker

1. **Good Workers**:
   - Each good worker can paint the house in 12 hours.
   - Therefore, the work rate of one good worker is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of good worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

2. **Bad Workers**:
   - Each bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours.
   - Therefore, the work rate of one bad worker is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of bad worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Work Done by Good Workers

Given that there are 3 good workers, the total work done by the good workers in 3 hours is:
\[
\text{Total work by good workers} = \text{Number of good workers} \times \text{Work rate of good worker} \times \text{Total time}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Total work by good workers} = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} \times 3 = \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Remaining Work

The total work needed to paint the house is 1 house. Therefore, the remaining work that needs to be done by the bad workers is:
\[
\text{Remaining work} = 1 - \text{Total work by good workers} = 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Work Done by Bad Workers

Let \( n \) be the number of bad workers needed. The total work done by \( n \) bad workers in 3 hours is:
\[
\text{Total work by bad workers} = n \times \text{Work rate of bad worker} \times \text{Total time}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Total work by bad workers} = n \times \frac{1}{36} \times 3 = \frac{n}{12} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 5: Set Up the Equation

To find the number of bad workers needed, we set the total work done by bad workers equal to the remaining work:
\[
\frac{n}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 6: Solve for \( n \)

To solve for \( n \), we multiply both sides by 12:
\[
n = 12 \times \frac{1}{4} = 3
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the number of bad workers needed to complete the painting of the house in 3 hours, along with the 3 good workers, is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.018487050000000005

What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To solve the problem of finding a common English word with a product value of 715, we will follow a systematic approach involving prime factorization and letter value mapping.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 715
First, we need to factor the number 715 into its prime components.

- **Dividing by 5**: 
  \[
  715 \div 5 = 143
  \]
- **Dividing 143 by 11**: 
  \[
  143 \div 11 = 13
  \]
- **13 is a prime number**.

Thus, the complete prime factorization of 715 is:
\[
715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
\]

### Step 2: Mapping Prime Factors to Letter Values
Next, we will map these prime factors to their corresponding letter values based on the given mapping where A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26.

- **5 corresponds to E**
- **11 corresponds to K**
- **13 corresponds to M**

### Step 3: Forming the Word
Now, we can combine these letters to form a word. The letters we have are E, K, and M. 

### Step 4: Checking for Common English Words
The letters E, K, and M can be rearranged to form the word ""MEK"", ""KEM"", or ""EKM"". However, none of these combinations are common English words.

### Step 5: Conclusion
Since the letters derived from the prime factorization do not form a common English word, we need to consider if there are any other combinations or additional letters that could yield a product value of 715. 

However, based on the prime factorization and the letter values, the only letters we can derive are E, K, and M. 

### Final Answer
Thus, the common English word that corresponds to the product value of 715, based on the prime factorization and letter values, is not found. The derived letters are E, K, and M, but they do not form a recognizable English word.

If we were to state the derived letters, we would write:
\[
\text{Derived Letters: E, K, M}

Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"To solve the problem of estimating \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred and performing prime factorization, we will follow a structured approach. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Square of the Target Value

First, we need to calculate the square of \( 14.7923412 \):

\[
14.7923412^2 = 14.7923412 \times 14.7923412 \approx 218.81335817721742
\]

### Step 2: Round to the Nearest Hundred

Next, we round the squared value to the nearest hundred. The squared value is approximately \( 218.81 \). When rounding to the nearest hundred, we look at the tens digit (which is 1 in this case):

\[
\text{Rounded value} = 200
\]

### Step 3: Perform Prime Factorization

Now, we need to perform the prime factorization of the rounded value \( 200 \).

1. Start with \( 200 \):
   \[
   200 = 2 \times 100
   \]
2. Factor \( 100 \):
   \[
   100 = 2 \times 50
   \]
3. Factor \( 50 \):
   \[
   50 = 2 \times 25
   \]
4. Factor \( 25 \):
   \[
   25 = 5 \times 5
   \]

Putting it all together, we have:

\[
200 = 2^3 \times 5^2
\]

### Step 4: List of Prime Factors and Corresponding Letter Values

From the prime factorization \( 200 = 2^3 \times 5^2 \), we can identify the prime factors and their counts:

- \( 2 \) appears \( 3 \) times.
- \( 5 \) appears \( 2 \) times.

Now, we can map these prime factors to their corresponding letter values based on the provided mapping:

- \( 2 \) corresponds to \( B \)
- \( 5 \) corresponds to \( E \)

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem, we need to analyze the situation where a square piece of paper is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, creating two congruent triangles. We are given that the area of the original square is \(49\) square inches.

### Step 1: Calculate the Side Length of the Square
The area \(A\) of a square is given by the formula:
\[
A = s^2
\]
where \(s\) is the side length of the square. Given that the area is \(49\) square inches, we can find the side length:
\[
s^2 = 49 \implies s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Understand the Folding Process
When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, the fold creates two right triangles. Each triangle has legs that are half the side length of the square.

### Step 3: Calculate the Legs of the Triangle
Since the side length of the square is \(7\) inches, the legs of each triangle (which are formed by the fold) are:
\[
\text{leg} = \frac{s}{2} = \frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Hypotenuse of the Triangle
Using the Pythagorean theorem, the hypotenuse \(h\) of the triangle can be calculated as follows:
\[
h = \sqrt{(\text{leg})^2 + (\text{leg})^2} = \sqrt{(3.5)^2 + (3.5)^2} = \sqrt{2 \times (3.5)^2}
\]
Calculating \((3.5)^2\):
\[
(3.5)^2 = 12.25
\]
Thus,
\[
h = \sqrt{2 \times 12.25} = \sqrt{24.5} = 3.5\sqrt{2}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Perimeter of One Triangle
The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides:
\[
P = \text{leg} + \text{leg} + \text{hypotenuse} = 3.5 + 3.5 + 3.5\sqrt{2}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
P = 7 + 3.5\sqrt{2}
\]

### Final Answer
The perimeter of one of the triangles, expressed in simplest radical form, is:
\[
\boxed{7 + 3.5\sqrt{2}}
\]","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.02035755000000001
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of counting the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships, we will break down the calculations step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the Setup
- There are **3 teams**.
- Each team has **4 players**.
- Each player shakes hands **3 times** with every member of the opposing teams and **once** with each member of their own team.

### Step 2: Calculate Total Players
The total number of players can be calculated as:
\[
\text{Total Players} = \text{Number of Teams} \times \text{Players per Team} = 3 \times 4 = 12
\]

### Step 3: Handshakes with Opposing Teams
Each player shakes hands with:
- **3 handshakes** with each of the 8 players from the opposing teams (since there are 2 opposing teams, each with 4 players).
- Therefore, the total handshakes a single player has with opposing teams is:
\[
\text{Handshakes with Opponents} = 3 \times 8 = 24
\]

### Step 4: Handshakes with Own Team
Each player shakes hands **once** with each of the 3 other players on their own team. The number of handshakes within a team of 4 players is given by:
\[
\text{Handshakes with Own Team} = \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
\]

### Step 5: Total Handshakes for All Players
Now, we can calculate the total handshakes for all players:
- Each player has a total of:
\[
\text{Total Handshakes per Player} = \text{Handshakes with Opponents} + \text{Handshakes with Own Team} = 24 + 6 = 30
\]
- Since there are 12 players, the total number of handshakes is:
\[
\text{Total Handshakes} = \frac{12 \times 30}{2} = 180
\]
(Note: We divide by 2 to avoid double counting each handshake.)

### Step 6: Prime Factorization of Total Handshakes
Now we will perform the prime factorization of 180:
1. Divide by 2:
   \[
   180 \div 2 = 90
   \]
2. Divide by 2 again:
   \[
   90 \div 2 = 45
   \]
3. Divide by 3:
   \[
   45 \div 3 = 15
   \]
4. Divide by 3 again:
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]
5. Finally, 5 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 180 is:
\[
180 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^1
\]

### Final Answer
The total number of handshakes is:
\[
\boxed{180}
\]

And the prime factorization is:
\[
\text{Prime Factorization: } 180 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^1
\]","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

     - \(2 + (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5)\)
     - \((2 + 3) + (4 + 5)\)

3. **Calculating Each Parenthesization**:
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 6 \cdot 20 = 120\)
   - \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 = (2 \cdot 12) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 + 5 = 6 \cdot 4 + 5 = 24 + 5 = 29\)
   - \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) = 2 \cdot (3 \cdot 20) = 2 \cdot 60 = 120\)
   - \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4) + 5 = 2 \cdot 12 + 5 = 24 + 5 = 29\)
   - \(2 + (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) = 2 + (3 \cdot 20) = 2 + 60 = 62\)
   - \((2 + 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 5 \cdot 20 = 100\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3) + (4 \cdot 5) = 6 + 20 = 26\)
   - \(2 + (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) = 2 + 60 = 62\)
   - \((2 + 3) + (4 + 5) = 5 + 9 = 14\)

4. **Distinct Values**:
   Now we compile the distinct results from the calculations:
   - \(121\)
   - \(120\)
   - \(29\)
   - \(62\)
   - \(100\)
   - \(26\)
   - \(14\)

   The distinct values obtained are:
   \[
   \{121, 120, 29, 62, 100, 26, 14\}
   \]

5. **Counting Distinct Values**:
   The total number of distinct values is \(7\).

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of distinct values that can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.
\end{align*}In total there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for the expression.",0,0.02430135000000001
"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To solve the problem of how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we will follow a structured approach. 

### Step 1: Identify the Options for Each Feature
Tom's Mr. Potato Head comes with the following options:
- **Hairstyles**: 3 options (including bald)
- **Eyebrows**: 2 options
- **Eyes**: 1 option
- **Ears**: 2 options
- **Lips**: 2 options
- **Shoes**: 2 options

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Combinations
To find the total number of different personalities, we multiply the number of options for each feature:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = (\text{Hairstyles}) \times (\text{Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Eyes}) \times (\text{Ears}) \times (\text{Lips}) \times (\text{Shoes})
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

Calculating step-by-step:

1. \(3 \times 2 = 6\)
2. \(6 \times 1 = 6\)
3. \(6 \times 2 = 12\)
4. \(12 \times 2 = 24\)
5. \(24 \times 2 = 48\)

Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities is:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 48
\]

### Step 3: Prime Factorization of 48
Next, we will find the prime factorization of 48. 

To factor 48, we can start by dividing by the smallest prime number, which is 2:

1. \(48 \div 2 = 24\)
2. \(24 \div 2 = 12\)
3. \(12 \div 2 = 6\)
4. \(6 \div 2 = 3\)
5. \(3\) is a prime number.

Thus, we can express 48 as:

\[
48 = 2^4 \times 3^1
\]

### Step 4: Summary of Results
- The total number of different wacky personalities Tom can create is \(48\).
- The prime factorization of \(48\) is \(2^4 \times 3^1\).

### Final Answer
The final answer, formatted in LaTeX notation, is:

\[
\boxed{48}
\]","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",0,0.018964950000000005
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To solve the problem of how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one '0', we can break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define the Range
We are interested in whole numbers between 100 and 999, as these are the three-digit numbers. The range of numbers we will consider is from 100 to 999 inclusive.

### Step 2: Identify the Structure of Three-Digit Numbers
A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
- \(a\) is the hundreds place (can be from 1 to 9),
- \(b\) is the tens place (can be from 0 to 9),
- \(c\) is the units place (can be from 0 to 9).

### Step 3: Conditions for Exactly One '0'
For a number to contain exactly one '0', we can have the following scenarios:
1. The '0' is in the tens place: \(a0c\)
2. The '0' is in the units place: \(ab0\)

### Step 4: Count Valid Combinations
#### Case 1: '0' in the Tens Place (Form: \(a0c\))
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be '0' to ensure exactly one '0') (9 options).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \times 9 = 81
\]

#### Case 2: '0' in the Units Place (Form: \(ab0\))
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(b\) can be any digit from 0 to 9, but it cannot be '0' (to ensure exactly one '0') (9 options).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \times 9 = 81
\]

### Step 5: Combine the Results
Now, we add the results from both cases:
\[
81 + 81 = 162
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of whole numbers between 100 and 999 that contain exactly one '0' is:

\[
\boxed{162}
\]","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.013087200000000002
