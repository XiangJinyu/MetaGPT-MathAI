"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem regarding the angles of a convex pentagon, we will follow a structured approach. 

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let:
- \( x \) be the measure of each acute angle.
- \( y \) be the measure of each large angle.

### Step 2: Set Up Equations
From the problem statement, we know:
1. There are two acute angles: \( x, x \).
2. There are three large angles: \( y, y, y \).
3. The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180 = 540 \text{ degrees}
   \]

This leads us to the first equation:
\[
2x + 3y = 540
\]

Additionally, we know that each large angle is equal to the sum of the two acute angles:
\[
y = 2x
\]

### Step 3: Substitute and Solve
Now, we can substitute \( y \) in the first equation:
\[
2x + 3(2x) = 540
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 6x = 540
\]
\[
8x = 540
\]
Now, divide both sides by 8:
\[
x = \frac{540}{8} = 67.5 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Large Angle
Now, we can find \( y \):
\[
y = 2x = 2 \times 67.5 = 135 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 5: Final Answer
Thus, the common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]

### Step 6: Prime Factorization of 135
To find the prime factorization of 135:
1. Start with \( 135 \):
   - \( 135 = 3 \times 45 \)
   - \( 45 = 3 \times 15 \)
   - \( 15 = 3 \times 5 \)

Thus, the prime factorization of 135 is:
\[
135 = 3^3 \times 5^1
\]

### Summary
- The common measure of the large angles is \( \boxed{135} \).
- The prime factorization of 135 is \( 3^3 \times 5^1 \).","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.024309150000000005

[/asy]","To solve the problem of finding the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sums of each row, column, and diagonal are equal. Let's break down the solution step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define the Magic Square

The magic square is defined as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Sums of Each Row

1. **Row 1**: 
   \[
   S_1 = (n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 = 2n + 1
   \]

2. **Row 2**: 
   \[
   S_2 = 3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
   \]

3. **Row 3**: 
   \[
   S_3 = (n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

### Step 3: Set the Sums Equal

Since \( S_1 \) and \( S_3 \) are equal, we can set them equal to \( S_2 \):

1. Set \( S_1 = S_2 \):
   \[
   2n + 1 = 3n - 6
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies n = 7
   \]

2. Set \( S_2 = S_3 \):
   \[
   3n - 6 = 2n + 1
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   3n - 2n = 1 + 6 \implies n = 7
   \]

### Step 4: Verify the Solution

Now, let's substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square to verify that all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to the same value.

1. **Substituting \( n = 7 \)**:
   \[
   \begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
   \hline
   4 & 9 & 2 \\
   \hline
   3 & 5 & 7 \\
   \hline
   8 & 1 & 6 \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   \]

2. **Calculating the sums**:
   - **Row 1**: \( 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \)
   - **Row 2**: \( 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \)
   - **Row 3**: \( 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \)

   - **Column 1**: \( 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \)
   - **Column 2**: \( 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \)
   - **Column 3**: \( 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \)

   - **Diagonal 1**: \( 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)
   - **Diagonal 2**: \( 2 + 5 + 8 = 15 \)

All sums are equal to 15, confirming that the magic square is valid.

### Final Answer

Thus, the value of \( n \) is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem of how many bad workers are needed to paint the house in 3 hours, we will follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Determine the Work Rate of Each Worker

1. **Good Workers**:
   - Each good worker can paint the house in 12 hours.
   - Therefore, the work rate of one good worker is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of good worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

2. **Bad Workers**:
   - Each bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours.
   - Therefore, the work rate of one bad worker is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of bad worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Work Done by Good Workers

- We have 3 good workers, and they will work for 3 hours. The total work done by the good workers is:
\[
\text{Total work by good workers} = \text{Number of good workers} \times \text{Work rate of good worker} \times \text{Time}
\]
\[
= 3 \times \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} \times 3 = \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Remaining Work

- The total work needed to paint the house is 1 house. The remaining work that needs to be done by bad workers is:
\[
\text{Remaining work} = 1 - \text{Total work by good workers} = 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Work Done by Bad Workers

- Let \( n \) be the number of bad workers needed. The total work done by \( n \) bad workers in 3 hours is:
\[
\text{Total work by bad workers} = n \times \text{Work rate of bad worker} \times \text{Time}
\]
\[
= n \times \frac{1}{36} \times 3 = \frac{n}{12} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 5: Set Up the Equation

- We need the total work done by bad workers to equal the remaining work:
\[
\frac{n}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 6: Solve for \( n \)

- To solve for \( n \), we multiply both sides by 12:
\[
n = 12 \times \frac{1}{4} = 3
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the number of bad workers needed to ensure the house is painted in 3 hours is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.01991265
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To solve the problem of finding a common English word with a product value of 715, we will follow a systematic approach involving prime factorization and letter mapping.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 715
First, we need to factor the number 715 into its prime components:

\[
715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
\]

### Step 2: Mapping Prime Factors to Letters
Next, we will map these prime factors to their corresponding letter values based on the given mapping where \( A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, \ldots, Z = 26 \):

- \( 5 \) corresponds to the letter \( E \)
- \( 11 \) corresponds to the letter \( K \)
- \( 13 \) corresponds to the letter \( M \)

### Step 3: Forming the Word
Using the letters derived from the prime factors, we can form the word:

\[
\text{Word} = EKM
\]

### Step 4: Verification of Product Value
To ensure that the product value of the word ""EKM"" is indeed 715, we calculate the product of the letter values:

\[
\text{Product Value} = 5 \times 11 \times 13 = 715
\]

### Conclusion
The calculations confirm that the product value of the word ""EKM"" is correct. 

Thus, the common English word with a product value of 715 is:

\[
\boxed{EKM}
\]","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}

Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"To solve the problem of estimating \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred and performing prime factorization, we will follow a structured approach. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Square of the Target Value

First, we need to calculate the square of \( 14.7923412 \):

\[
14.7923412^2 = 14.7923412 \times 14.7923412 \approx 218.81335817721742
\]

### Step 2: Round to the Nearest Hundred

Next, we round the squared value to the nearest hundred. The squared value is approximately \( 218.81 \). When rounding to the nearest hundred, we look at the tens digit (which is 1 in this case):

\[
\text{Rounded value} = 200
\]

### Step 3: Perform Prime Factorization

Now, we need to perform the prime factorization of the rounded value \( 200 \).

1. Start with \( 200 \):
   - Divide by \( 2 \): \( 200 \div 2 = 100 \)
   - Divide by \( 2 \): \( 100 \div 2 = 50 \)
   - Divide by \( 2 \): \( 50 \div 2 = 25 \)
   - Now \( 25 \) is not divisible by \( 2 \), so we move to the next prime number, which is \( 5 \):
   - Divide by \( 5 \): \( 25 \div 5 = 5 \)
   - Divide by \( 5 \): \( 5 \div 5 = 1 \)

Thus, the prime factorization of \( 200 \) is:

\[
200 = 2^3 \times 5^2
\]

### Step 4: List of Prime Factors and Corresponding Letter Values

From the prime factorization \( 200 = 2^3 \times 5^2 \), we can identify the prime factors and their corresponding letter values:

- \( 2 \) corresponds to \( B \)
- \( 5 \) corresponds to \( E \)

### Summary of Results

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem, we need to analyze the situation where a square piece of paper is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, forming two congruent triangles. We are given that the area of the original square is \(49\) square inches. Let's break down the solution step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Side Length of the Square
The area \(A\) of a square is given by the formula:
\[
A = s^2
\]
where \(s\) is the side length of the square. Given that the area is \(49\) square inches, we can find the side length:
\[
s^2 = 49 \implies s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Understand the Folding Process
When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, the fold creates two congruent right triangles. The legs of each triangle will be half the side length of the square.

### Step 3: Calculate the Legs of the Triangle
Since the side length of the square is \(7\) inches, the length of each leg of the triangle (which is half the side length) is:
\[
\text{leg} = \frac{s}{2} = \frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Hypotenuse of the Triangle
Using the Pythagorean theorem, the hypotenuse \(h\) of the triangle can be calculated as follows:
\[
h = \sqrt{\text{leg}^2 + \text{leg}^2} = \sqrt{(3.5)^2 + (3.5)^2} = \sqrt{2 \times (3.5)^2} = \sqrt{2 \times 12.25} = \sqrt{24.5} = 3.5\sqrt{2} \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Perimeter of One Triangle
The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides:
\[
P = \text{leg} + \text{leg} + \text{hypotenuse} = 3.5 + 3.5 + 3.5\sqrt{2}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
P = 7 + 3.5\sqrt{2} \text{ inches}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the perimeter of one of the triangles, expressed in simplest radical form, is:
\[
\boxed{7 + 3.5\sqrt{2}}
\]","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.0194157
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of counting the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships, we will break down the calculations step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the Setup
- There are **3 teams**.
- Each team has **4 players**.
- Each player shakes hands **3 times** with every member of the opposing teams and **once** with each member of their own team.

### Step 2: Calculate Total Players
The total number of players can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Total Players} = \text{Number of Teams} \times \text{Players per Team} = 3 \times 4 = 12
\]

### Step 3: Handshakes with Opposing Teams
Each player shakes hands with:
- **3 handshakes** with each member of the opposing teams.
- There are **2 opposing teams** (since a player does not shake hands with their own team).

The number of players in the opposing teams is:
\[
\text{Players in Opposing Teams} = 2 \times 4 = 8
\]

Thus, the total handshakes with opposing teams for one player is:
\[
\text{Handshakes with Opponents} = 8 \times 3 = 24
\]

Since there are **12 players**, the total handshakes with opposing teams is:
\[
\text{Total Handshakes with Opponents} = 12 \times 24 = 288
\]

### Step 4: Handshakes with Own Team
Each player shakes hands **once** with each member of their own team. For a team of 4 players, the number of handshakes within a team is given by the combination formula \(C(n, 2)\), where \(n\) is the number of players in the team:
\[
\text{Handshakes within Own Team} = C(4, 2) = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
\]

Since there are **3 teams**, the total handshakes within all teams is:
\[
\text{Total Handshakes within Own Teams} = 3 \times 6 = 18
\]

### Step 5: Total Handshakes
Now, we can sum the total handshakes from both opposing teams and own teams:
\[
\text{Total Handshakes} = \text{Total Handshakes with Opponents} + \text{Total Handshakes within Own Teams} = 288 + 18 = 306
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships is:
\[
\boxed{306}
\]","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

     \[
     = 2 + 3 + 20 = 25
     \]
   - \((2 + 3 + 4) \cdot 5\)
     \[
     = 9 \cdot 5 = 45
     \]
   - \(2 \cdot 3 + 4 \cdot 5\)
     \[
     = 6 + 20 = 26
     \]

4. **Collecting All Distinct Values**:
   From the evaluations above, we have the following distinct results before adding \(1\):
   - \(120\)
   - \(29\)
   - \(26\)
   - \(62\)
   - \(100\)
   - \(15\)
   - \(25\)
   - \(45\)

5. **Adding 1 to Each Value**:
   Now, we add \(1\) to each of these results:
   - \(120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \(29 + 1 = 30\)
   - \(26 + 1 = 27\)
   - \(62 + 1 = 63\)
   - \(100 + 1 = 101\)
   - \(15 + 1 = 16\)
   - \(25 + 1 = 26\)
   - \(45 + 1 = 46\)

6. **Final Distinct Values**:
   The final distinct values obtained are:
   - \(121\)
   - \(30\)
   - \(27\)
   - \(63\)
   - \(101\)
   - \(16\)
   - \(26\)
   - \(46\)

7. **Counting Distinct Values**:
   We count the distinct values:
   - Total distinct values = \(8\)

The total number of distinct values that can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.
\end{align*}In total there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for the expression.",0,0.022038300000000004
"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To solve the problem of how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we will follow a structured approach. 

### Step 1: Identify the Options for Each Feature
Tom's Mr. Potato Head comes with the following options:
- **Hairstyles**: 3 options (including bald)
- **Eyebrows**: 2 options
- **Eyes**: 1 option
- **Ears**: 2 options
- **Lips**: 2 options
- **Shoes**: 2 options

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Number of Combinations
To find the total number of different personalities, we multiply the number of options for each feature together:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = (\text{Hairstyles}) \times (\text{Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Eyes}) \times (\text{Ears}) \times (\text{Lips}) \times (\text{Shoes})
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

Calculating step-by-step:

1. \(3 \times 2 = 6\)
2. \(6 \times 1 = 6\)
3. \(6 \times 2 = 12\)
4. \(12 \times 2 = 24\)
5. \(24 \times 2 = 48\)

Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities is:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 48
\]

### Step 3: Prime Factorization of 48
Next, we perform the prime factorization of 48. 

1. Start with 48:
   \[
   48 = 2 \times 24
   \]
2. Factor 24:
   \[
   24 = 2 \times 12
   \]
3. Factor 12:
   \[
   12 = 2 \times 6
   \]
4. Factor 6:
   \[
   6 = 2 \times 3
   \]

Putting it all together, we have:

\[
48 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 = 2^4 \times 3^1
\]

### Step 4: Summary of Results
- **Total Personalities**: 48
- **Prime Factorization**: \( 48 = 2^4 \times 3^1 \)

### Final Answer
The total number of different wacky personalities Tom can create is:

\[
\boxed{48}
\]

And the prime factorization of 48 is:

\[
\boxed{2^4 \times 3^1}
\]","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",0,0.015624
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To solve the problem of how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one '0', we can break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define the Range
We are interested in whole numbers between 100 and 999, inclusive. This means we will consider three-digit numbers.

### Step 2: Identify the Structure of Three-Digit Numbers
A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
- \(a\) is the hundreds place (can be from 1 to 9),
- \(b\) is the tens place (can be from 0 to 9),
- \(c\) is the units place (can be from 0 to 9).

### Step 3: Conditions for Exactly One '0'
For a number to contain exactly one '0', we can have the following scenarios:
1. The '0' is in the tens place (\(a0c\)).
2. The '0' is in the units place (\(ab0\)).

### Step 4: Count Valid Combinations

#### Case 1: '0' in the Tens Place (\(a0c\))
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be '0' to satisfy the condition of having exactly one '0') (9 options).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \times 9 = 81
\]

#### Case 2: '0' in the Units Place (\(ab0\))
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(b\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be '0' to satisfy the condition of having exactly one '0') (9 options).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \times 9 = 81
\]

### Step 5: Combine the Results
Now, we add the results from both cases:
\[
81 + 81 = 162
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of whole numbers between 100 and 999 that contain exactly one '0' is:

\[
\boxed{162}
\]","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.01900545
