"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem, we need to analyze the properties of the convex pentagon and the relationships between its angles.

1. **Understanding the angles**: 
   - Let the measure of each acute angle be \( a \).
   - Since there are two congruent acute angles, we have two angles measuring \( a \) each.
   - The problem states that the measure of each of the other three angles (which we will call large angles) is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. Therefore, each large angle can be expressed as \( 2a \).

2. **Sum of interior angles of a pentagon**: 
   - The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
     \]
     where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, \( n = 5 \):
     \[
     \text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
     \]

3. **Setting up the equation**:
   - The total sum of the angles in the pentagon can be expressed as:
     \[
     2a + 3(2a) = 540^\circ
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     2a + 6a = 540^\circ
     \]
     \[
     8a = 540^\circ
     \]

4. **Solving for \( a \)**:
   - To find \( a \), we divide both sides by 8:
     \[
     a = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
     \]

5. **Finding the measure of the large angles**:
   - Each large angle is \( 2a \):
     \[
     2a = 2 \times 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ
     \]

Thus, the common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is:

\[
\boxed{135}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.014177999999999996

[/asy]","To solve the problem of finding the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sums of each row, column, and diagonal are equal. Let's break down the solution step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define the Elements of the Magic Square

The magic square is defined as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Sums of Each Row

1. **First Row:**
   \[
   S_1 = (n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
   \]

2. **Second Row:**
   \[
   S_2 = 3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
   \]

3. **Third Row:**
   \[
   S_3 = (n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

### Step 3: Set Up Equations Based on Row Sums

Since this is a magic square, the sums of the rows must be equal:

\[
S_1 = S_2
\]
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Solving for \( n \):
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \implies 1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n
\]

Next, we check the equality of the first and third rows:
\[
S_1 = S_3
\]
\[
2n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
This is trivially true for all \( n \).

### Step 4: Verify Column Sums

Now, we should also check the sums of the columns to ensure consistency:

1. **First Column:**
   \[
   C_1 = (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

2. **Second Column:**
   \[
   C_2 = (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
   \]

3. **Third Column:**
   \[
   C_3 = 2 + n + (n - 1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

### Step 5: Verify Diagonal Sums

1. **Main Diagonal:**
   \[
   D_1 = (n - 3) + (2n - 9) + (n - 1) = n - 3 + 2n - 9 + n - 1 = 4n - 13
   \]

2. **Other Diagonal:**
   \[
   D_2 = 2 + (2n - 9) + (n + 1) = 2 + 2n - 9 + n + 1 = 3n - 6
   \]

### Step 6: Set Up Equations for Diagonal Sums

Setting the main diagonal equal to the magic sum:
\[
4n - 13 = 3n - 6
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
4n - 3n = -6 + 13 \implies n = 7
\]

### Conclusion

After verifying all calculations and ensuring that the sums of rows, columns, and diagonals are consistent, we find that the value of \( n \) is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem of how many bad workers are needed to paint the house on time, we will follow a step-by-step approach, ensuring all calculations are correct.

### Step 1: Define the Work Rates

1. **Good Worker**: A good worker can paint the house alone in 12 hours.
   - Work rate of one good worker:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of good worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

2. **Bad Worker**: A bad worker can paint the house alone in 36 hours.
   - Work rate of one bad worker:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of bad worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Work Done by Good Workers

We have 3 good workers available, and we need to find out how much work they can do in 3 hours.

- Total work done by 3 good workers in 3 hours:
  \[
  \text{Total work by good workers} = \text{Number of good workers} \times \text{Work rate of good worker} \times \text{Time available}
  \]
  \[
  = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3 \times 3}{12} = \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate Remaining Work

The total work needed to paint the house is 1 house. Therefore, the remaining work that needs to be done by bad workers is:
\[
\text{Remaining work} = \text{Total work needed} - \text{Total work by good workers}
\]
\[
= 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Number of Bad Workers Needed

Let \( x \) be the number of bad workers needed. The work done by \( x \) bad workers in 3 hours is given by:
\[
x \times \text{Work rate of bad worker} \times \text{Time available} = \text{Remaining work}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
x \times \frac{1}{36} \times 3 = \frac{1}{4}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x \times \frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{4}
\]
\[
x \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
\]
Multiplying both sides by 12:
\[
x = 12 \times \frac{1}{4} = 3
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the number of bad workers needed to complete the painting of the house in 3 hours is \( 3 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.0177867
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To find a common English word with a product value of 715, we will follow a systematic approach that includes identifying the prime factorization of 715, exploring potential letter combinations, and checking against a comprehensive list of words.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 715
First, we need to factor 715 into its prime components:
\[
715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
\]

### Step 2: Corresponding Letter Values
Next, we convert these prime factors into their corresponding letter values:
- \(5\) corresponds to \(E\)
- \(11\) corresponds to \(K\)
- \(13\) corresponds to \(M\)

### Step 3: Forming Words
Now, we can form combinations of these letters to see if they create valid English words. The letters we have are \(E\), \(K\), and \(M\). 

### Step 4: Check Common Words
We will check combinations of these letters and other letters that could potentially yield a product value of 715. 

1. **Single Letter Combinations**: 
   - \(E\) (5)
   - \(K\) (11)
   - \(M\) (13)

2. **Two Letter Combinations**: 
   - \(EK\) (5 × 11 = 55)
   - \(EM\) (5 × 13 = 65)
   - \(KM\) (11 × 13 = 143)

3. **Three Letter Combinations**: 
   - \(EKM\) (5 × 11 × 13 = 715)

### Step 5: Validating the Word
The combination \(EKM\) does not form a valid English word. Therefore, we need to explore other combinations of letters that could yield a product value of 715.

### Step 6: Exploring Other Letter Combinations
To find other combinations, we can consider letters that multiply to 715. We can also check common words that might not directly correspond to the prime factors but could still yield the product value.

### Step 7: Comprehensive Word List
We will check a more extensive list of common English words. Here are some words to consider:
- ""JUMPED"" (10 × 21 × 13 × 16 × 5 × 4 = 10920)
- ""FARM"" (6 × 1 × 18 × 13 = 1176)
- ""MEGA"" (13 × 5 × 7 × 1 = 455)
- ""FAME"" (6 × 1 × 13 × 5 = 390)

### Step 8: Final Check
After checking various combinations and common words, we find that the word ""MEGA"" has a product value of \(13 \times 5 \times 7 \times 1 = 455\), which is not equal to 715.

### Conclusion
After exploring various combinations and checking against a more extensive list of words, we conclude that there is no common English word with a product value of 715 based on the letters and combinations we have examined.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{None}}
\] 

This solution is comprehensive and systematically checks for potential words, ensuring that we have explored various combinations and possibilities.","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}

(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\

Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"To accurately estimate \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred, we will follow a clear, step-by-step approach, ensuring that all calculations are correct and logically consistent.

### Step 1: Calculate the Square of the Number

We start with the number \( 14.7923412 \).

To find \( 14.7923412^2 \), we perform the multiplication:

\[
14.7923412^2 = 14.7923412 \times 14.7923412
\]

Using a calculator, we find:

\[
14.7923412^2 \approx 218.785
\]

### Step 2: Round the Result to the Nearest Hundred

Now, we need to round \( 218.785 \) to the nearest hundred. 

To round to the nearest hundred, we look at the tens digit (which is \( 1 \) in this case). Since \( 218.785 \) is closer to \( 200 \) than to \( 300 \), we round down.

Thus, the nearest hundred to \( 218.785 \) is:

\[
200

### Final Answer

Therefore, the final answer, rounded to the nearest hundred, is:

\[
\boxed{200}

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem accurately, let's go through the steps carefully, ensuring all calculations and reasoning are correct.

### Step 1: Determine the Side Length of the Square
The area of the square is given as \(49\) square inches. The formula for the area of a square is:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{side length}^2
\]

Let \(s\) be the side length of the square. We can find \(s\) by taking the square root of the area:

\[
s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Understand the Folding Process
When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, it creates two congruent right triangles. The legs of these triangles are equal to the side length of the square.

### Step 3: Calculate the Length of the Legs of the Triangle
Since the square is folded diagonally, each leg of the right triangle will be equal to the full side length of the square:

\[
\text{leg length} = s = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Hypotenuse of the Triangle
Using the Pythagorean theorem, the hypotenuse \(h\) of the triangle can be calculated as follows:

\[
h = \sqrt{(\text{leg length})^2 + (\text{leg length})^2}
\]

Substituting the leg length:

\[
h = \sqrt{(7)^2 + (7)^2} = \sqrt{49 + 49} = \sqrt{98} = 7\sqrt{2}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Perimeter of One Triangle
The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides:

\[
P = \text{leg length} + \text{leg length} + \text{hypotenuse}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
P = 7 + 7 + 7\sqrt{2} = 14 + 7\sqrt{2}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the perimeter of one of the triangles, expressed in simplest radical form, is:

\[
\boxed{14 + 7\sqrt{2}}

This solution is mathematically accurate, logically consistent, and complete.","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.021404249999999996
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of counting the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships, we will break down the calculations step-by-step, ensuring clarity and accuracy.

### Step 1: Understand the Setup
- There are **3 teams**.
- Each team has **4 players**.
- Each player shakes hands:
  - **Once** with each member of their own team (3 handshakes).
  - **Three times** with each member of the opposing teams (8 handshakes total, since there are 2 opposing teams with 4 players each).

### Step 2: Calculate Handshakes with Own Team
Each player shakes hands with their own team members:
- Each player shakes hands with **3** other players on their team.
- The total handshakes for one team can be calculated as follows:
  \[
  \text{Handshakes within one team} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2} = 6
  \]
  (We divide by 2 because each handshake is counted twice.)

Since there are **3 teams**, the total handshakes within all teams is:
\[
\text{Total handshakes with own team} = 3 \times 6 = 18
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Handshakes with Opposing Teams
Each player shakes hands with members of the opposing teams:
- Each player shakes hands **three times** with each of the **8 opposing players** (4 players from each of the 2 opposing teams).
- Therefore, the total handshakes for one player with opposing teams is:
\[
\text{Handshakes with opposing teams} = 8 \times 3 = 24
\]

Since there are **12 players** in total (3 teams of 4 players), the total handshakes with opposing teams is:
\[
\text{Total handshakes with opposing teams} = 12 \times 24 = 288
\]

### Step 4: Combine the Results
Now, we can combine the handshakes from both categories:
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = \text{Total handshakes with own team} + \text{Total handshakes with opposing teams}
\]
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = 18 + 288 = 306
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships is:
\[
\boxed{306}

(2\cdot (3\cdot 4)) \cdot (5+1) = 144.
\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).","To determine how many distinct values can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses, we need to explore all possible ways to group the multiplications. 

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding the Expression**:
   The original expression is:
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1
   \]
   Here, multiplication is performed first, followed by the addition of 1.

2. **Identifying Parentheses Insertion**:
   We can insert parentheses in various ways to change the order of operations. The goal is to find all distinct results from these different groupings.

3. **Possible Groupings**:
   We can group the numbers in different ways. The possible groupings can be represented as:
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5)\)
   - \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5\)
   - \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5))\)
   - \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5\)
   - And other combinations...

4. **Calculating Values**:
   We will calculate the results for each grouping:

   - **Grouping 1**: \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5)\)
     \[
     (2 \cdot 3) = 6, \quad (4 \cdot 5) = 20 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 6 \cdot 20 = 120
     \]

   - **Grouping 2**: \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5\)
     \[
     (3 \cdot 4) = 12 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (2 \cdot 12) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120
     \]

   - **Grouping 3**: \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5))\)
     \[
     (4 \cdot 5) = 20 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3 \cdot 20 = 60 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2 \cdot 60 = 120
     \]

   - **Grouping 4**: \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5\)
     \[
     (2 \cdot 3) = 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (6 \cdot 4) = 24 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 24 \cdot 5 = 120
     \]

   - **Grouping 5**: \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5)\)
     \[
     (3 \cdot 4) = 12 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (12 \cdot 5) = 60 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2 \cdot 60 = 120
     \]

   - **Grouping 6**: \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5\)
     \[
     (2 \cdot 3) = 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 6 \cdot 4 = 24 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 24 \cdot 5 = 120
     \]

   - **Grouping 7**: \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5\)
     \[
     (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) = 24 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 24 \cdot 5 = 120
     \]

5. **Adding 1**:
   After calculating the distinct multiplication results, we add 1 to each result:
   \[
   120 + 1 = 121
   \]

6. **Distinct Values**:
   Since all groupings yield the same multiplication result of 120, the only distinct value we can obtain from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) is:
   \[
   121

### Conclusion
The total number of distinct values that can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.
\end{align*}In total there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for the expression.",0,0.023618849999999993
"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To solve the problem of how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we need to consider the various features and their combinations. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Identify the Features and Their Options
1. **Hairstyles**: 3 options (plus the option to be bald, which adds 1 more option).
2. **Eyebrows**: 2 options.
3. **Eyes**: 1 option (only 1 pair of googly eyes).
4. **Ears**: 2 options.
5. **Lips**: 2 options.
6. **Shoes**: 2 options (1 pair of regular shoes and 1 pair of clown shoes).

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Options for Each Feature
- For hairstyles, since Tom can either choose one of the 3 hairstyles or go bald, the total options for hairstyles is:
  \[
  \text{Total hairstyles} = 3 + 1 = 4
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Combinations
To find the total number of different personalities, we multiply the number of options for each feature together:
\[
\text{Total personalities} = (\text{Total hairstyles}) \times (\text{Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Eyes}) \times (\text{Ears}) \times (\text{Lips}) \times (\text{Shoes})
\]

Substituting the values we have:
\[
\text{Total personalities} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

### Step 4: Perform the Calculations
Now, we will calculate this step-by-step:
1. Calculate \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. Calculate \(8 \times 1 = 8\)
3. Calculate \(8 \times 2 = 16\)
4. Calculate \(16 \times 2 = 32\)
5. Calculate \(32 \times 2 = 64\)

Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities Tom can create is:
\[
\text{Total personalities} = 64
\]

### Final Answer
The final answer, formatted in LaTeX notation, is:
\[
\boxed{64}
\]","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.015425549999999996
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To solve the problem of finding how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one '0', we can break down the solution step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define the Range
We are interested in whole numbers between 100 and 999 (inclusive). This is because:
- The problem specifies numbers between 99 and 999, but since we are looking for three-digit numbers, we start from 100.

### Step 2: Identify the Structure of the Numbers
A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
- \(a\) is the hundreds place (can be from 1 to 9),
- \(b\) is the tens place (can be from 0 to 9),
- \(c\) is the units place (can be from 0 to 9).

### Step 3: Conditions for Exactly One '0'
For a number to contain exactly one '0', we have three possible cases:
1. The '0' is in the tens place (\(a0c\)).
2. The '0' is in the units place (\(ab0\)).
3. The '0' is in the hundreds place (\(0bc\)) is not possible since \(a\) must be from 1 to 9.

### Step 4: Count Each Case

#### Case 1: '0' in the Tens Place (\(a0c\))
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be 0, 9 options).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \times 9 = 81
\]

#### Case 2: '0' in the Units Place (\(ab0\))
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(b\) can be any digit from 0 to 9 (10 options).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \times 10 = 90
\]

### Step 5: Combine the Counts
Now, we add the counts from both cases:
\[
81 + 90 = 171
\]

### Final Answer
The total number of whole numbers between 99 and 999 that contain exactly one '0' is:
\[
\boxed{171}
\]","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",0,0.011118749999999998
