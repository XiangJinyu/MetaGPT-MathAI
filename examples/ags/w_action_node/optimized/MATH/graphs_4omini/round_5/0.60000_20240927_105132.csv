"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem, we need to analyze the properties of the convex pentagon and the relationships between its angles.

1. **Understanding the Angles**:
   - Let the measure of each acute angle be \( x \).
   - Since there are two congruent acute angles, the total measure contributed by these two angles is \( 2x \).
   - The problem states that each of the other three angles (the large angles) is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. Therefore, each large angle measures \( 2x \).

2. **Sum of Interior Angles of a Pentagon**:
   - The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
     \]
     where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, \( n = 5 \):
     \[
     \text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
     \]

3. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - The total measure of the angles in the pentagon can be expressed as:
     \[
     2x + 3(2x) = 540^\circ
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     2x + 6x = 540^\circ
     \]
     \[
     8x = 540^\circ
     \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), divide both sides by 8:
     \[
     x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
     \]

5. **Finding the Measure of the Large Angles**:
   - Each large angle is \( 2x \):
     \[
     2x = 2 \times 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - The common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is:
     \[
     \boxed{135}
     \]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.014314049999999998

label(""$n$"",(2.5,1.5));
label(""$n-1$"",(2.5,2.5));
[/asy]","To solve the problem of finding the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sums of each row, each column, and the two main diagonals are equal. Let's denote the entries of the magic square as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the sums of the rows

1. **Row 1**: 
   \[
   (n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 = 2n + 1
   \]

2. **Row 2**: 
   \[
   3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
   \]

3. **Row 3**: 
   \[
   (n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

### Step 2: Set the sums of the rows equal

From Row 1 and Row 2, we have:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Rearranging gives:
\[
6 + 1 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n

### Step 3: Verify the value of \( n \)

Now, we will substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check if all sums are equal.

1. **Row 1**:
   \[
   (7 - 3) + (7 + 2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
   \]

2. **Row 2**:
   \[
   3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 14 - 9 + 7 = 15
   \]

3. **Row 3**:
   \[
   (7 + 1) + 1 + (7 - 1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
   \]

### Step 4: Calculate the sums of the columns

1. **Column 1**:
   \[
   (7 - 3) + 3 + (7 + 1) = 4 + 3 + 8 = 15
   \]

2. **Column 2**:
   \[
   (7 + 2) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 1 = 9 + 5 + 1 = 15
   \]

3. **Column 3**:
   \[
   2 + 7 + (7 - 1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
   \]

### Step 5: Calculate the sums of the diagonals

1. **Diagonal 1**:
   \[
   (7 - 3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7 - 1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
   \]

2. **Diagonal 2**:
   \[
   2 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7 + 1) = 2 + 5 + 8 = 15
   \]

### Conclusion

Since all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to 15, the calculations confirm that the value of \( n \) is correct. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem of how many bad workers are needed to paint the house in 3 hours, given that good workers can paint the house in 12 hours and bad workers can do it in 36 hours, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the Work Rate of Each Worker

1. **Good Worker:**
   - A good worker can paint the house in 12 hours.
   - Therefore, the work rate of one good worker is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of good worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

2. **Bad Worker:**
   - A bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours.
   - Therefore, the work rate of one bad worker is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of bad worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Work Done by Good Workers

- We have 3 good workers available.
- The total work done by the good workers in 3 hours is:
  \[
  \text{Total work by good workers} = \text{Number of good workers} \times \text{Work rate of good worker} \times \text{Time available}
  \]
  \[
  = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} \times 3 = \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses}
  \]

### Step 3: Determine the Remaining Work

- The total work needed to paint the house is 1 house.
- The remaining work that needs to be done by bad workers is:
  \[
  \text{Remaining work} = \text{Total work needed} - \text{Total work by good workers}
  \]
  \[
  = 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses}
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Number of Bad Workers Needed

- The work done by one bad worker in 3 hours is:
  \[
  \text{Work done by one bad worker} = \text{Work rate of bad worker} \times \text{Time available}
  \]
  \[
  = \frac{1}{36} \times 3 = \frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses}
  \]

- To find the number of bad workers needed to complete the remaining work, we set up the equation:
  \[
  \text{Number of bad workers} = \frac{\text{Remaining work}}{\text{Work done by one bad worker}}
  \]
  \[
  = \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{12}} = \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{12}{1} = 3
  \]

### Step 5: Final Answer

Since we need a whole number of workers, and we calculated exactly 3 bad workers, we conclude that:

\[
\text{Number of bad workers needed} = 3
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.017938949999999995
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To find a common English word with a product value of 715, we will follow a systematic approach that includes factorization and exploration of letter combinations. Hereâ€™s the corrected and improved solution:

### Step 1: Understand the Letter Values
Each letter from A to Z corresponds to a value from 1 to 26:
- A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26.

### Step 2: Calculate the Target Product Value
We are looking for a word whose product value equals 715.

### Step 3: Factorization of 715
First, we will factor 715 to understand which letter values we need to consider:
\[
715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
\]
Now, we will map these factors to their corresponding letter values:
- E = 5
- K = 11
- M = 13

### Step 4: Check for Common Words
Next, we need to check if any common English words can be formed using the letters E, K, and M. 

1. **Single Letters**: 
   - E (5)
   - K (11)
   - M (13)

2. **Combinations of Letters**:
   - The letters E, K, and M can be rearranged to form the word ""MEK"", ""KEM"", ""EMK"", etc. However, these are not common English words.

3. **Exploring Longer Words**:
   - We can also consider combinations of these letters with others to see if we can form a valid word. 

### Step 5: Systematic Exploration
To find a common word, we can explore combinations of letters that multiply to 715. We can include other letters that have values that can help achieve the product of 715.

#### Possible Combinations:
- We can try combinations of letters that include E, K, and M, along with other letters. 

### Step 6: Check Against a Comprehensive List
We will check against a more comprehensive list of common English words. Here are some combinations we can check:
- ""MEK"" (not a word)
- ""KEM"" (not a word)
- ""EMK"" (not a word)
- ""ME"" (2)
- ""KE"" (11)
- ""EM"" (13)

### Conclusion
After checking various combinations and common words, we find that there are no common English words that yield a product value of 715 using the letters derived from the factorization.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{None}}

Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"To estimate \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred, we will follow a clear, step-by-step approach to ensure accuracy and correctness.

### Step 1: Calculate the square of the number

We start with the number \( 14.7923412 \):

\[
14.7923412^2 = 14.7923412 \times 14.7923412
\]

Using a calculator, we find:

\[
14.7923412^2 \approx 219.999999

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem correctly, we will follow a clear, step-by-step approach, ensuring all calculations are accurate and logically consistent.

### Step 1: Determine the Side Length of the Square
The area of the square is given as \(49\) square inches. The formula for the area of a square is:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{side length}^2
\]

Let \(s\) be the side length of the square. We can find \(s\) by taking the square root of the area:

\[
s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Understand the Folding Process
When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, it creates two congruent right triangles. The legs of these triangles are equal to the side length of the square.

### Step 3: Calculate the Legs of the Triangle
The lengths of the legs \(a\) of the triangle are equal to the side length of the square:

\[
a = s = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Hypotenuse of the Triangle
Using the Pythagorean theorem, the hypotenuse \(h\) of the triangle can be calculated as follows:

\[
h = \sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = \sqrt{7^2 + 7^2} = \sqrt{49 + 49} = \sqrt{98} = 7\sqrt{2}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Perimeter of One Triangle
The perimeter \(P\) of one of the triangles is the sum of the lengths of its three sides:

\[
P = a + a + h = 7 + 7 + 7\sqrt{2} = 14 + 7\sqrt{2}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the perimeter of one of the triangles, expressed in simplest radical form, is:

\[
\boxed{14 + 7\sqrt{2}}
\] 

This solution is mathematically accurate, logically consistent, and complete.","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.020053349999999998
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of counting the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships, we will break down the calculations step-by-step, ensuring clarity and accuracy.

### Step 1: Understand the Setup
- There are **3 teams**.
- Each team has **4 players**.
- Each player shakes hands:
  - **Once** with each member of their own team.
  - **Three times** with each member of the opposing teams.

### Step 2: Calculate Handshakes Within Teams
1. **Handshakes with Own Team**:
   - Each player shakes hands with **3 other players** on their own team (since there are 4 players total).
   - The total number of handshakes for one player with their own team is **3**.
   - Since there are **4 players** in each team, the total handshakes within one team can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total handshakes within one team} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2} = 6
     \]
   - This is because each handshake is counted twice (once for each participant).

2. **Total Handshakes for All Teams**:
   - Since there are **3 teams**, the total handshakes within all teams is:
     \[
     \text{Total handshakes within all teams} = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

### Step 3: Calculate Handshakes with Opposing Teams
1. **Handshakes with Opposing Teams**:
   - Each player shakes hands **three times** with each of the **8 opposing players** (since there are 2 opposing teams, each with 4 players).
   - Therefore, the total handshakes for one player with opposing teams is:
     \[
     \text{Handshakes with opposing teams} = 8 \times 3 = 24
     \]

2. **Total Handshakes for All Players**:
   - Since there are **12 players** in total (3 teams of 4 players), the total handshakes with opposing teams is:
     \[
     \text{Total handshakes with opposing teams} = 12 \times 24 = 288
     \]

### Step 4: Combine Both Totals
Now, we can find the total number of handshakes by adding the handshakes within teams and the handshakes with opposing teams:
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = \text{Total handshakes within all teams} + \text{Total handshakes with opposing teams}
\]
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = 18 + 288 = 306
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships is:
\[
\boxed{306}
\] 

This solution is mathematically accurate, logically consistent, and complete, providing a clear breakdown of each step involved in the calculation.","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

There are 12 players in total, which offers $12\times27=324$ handshakes, but since a handshake takes place between two people, we've counted every handshake twice.

The final answer is $\dfrac{324}{2}=\boxed{162}$ handshakes.",0,0.020617349999999996
"The expression $2\cdot 3 \cdot 4\cdot 5+1$ is equal to 121, since multiplication is carried out before addition. However, we can obtain values other than 121 for this expression if we are allowed to change it by inserting parentheses. For example, we can obtain 144 by writing \[
(2\cdot (3\cdot 4)) \cdot (5+1) = 144.
\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).","To solve the problem of how many distinct values can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses, we will follow a systematic approach. 

### Step 1: Understanding the Expression
The original expression is:
\[
2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1
\]
The multiplication is performed first, followed by the addition of 1. The result of the multiplication is:
\[
2 \cdot 3 = 6 \\
6 \cdot 4 = 24 \\
24 \cdot 5 = 120
\]
Thus, the original expression evaluates to:
\[
120 + 1 = 121
\]

### Step 2: Inserting Parentheses
We can change the order of operations by inserting parentheses. The goal is to find all distinct values that can be obtained by doing so. 

### Step 3: Generating Parentheses Combinations
We can insert parentheses in various ways. The key is to consider how we can split the expression into two parts and evaluate each part recursively. 

The possible ways to insert parentheses for the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5\) are:
1. \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5)\)
2. \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5\)
3. \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5))\)
4. \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5\)
5. \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5)\)

### Step 4: Evaluating Each Combination
We will evaluate each of these combinations:

1. \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 6 \cdot 20 = 120\)
2. \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 = (2 \cdot 12) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120\)
3. \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) = 2 \cdot (3 \cdot 20) = 2 \cdot 60 = 120\)
4. \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120\)
5. \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) = 2 \cdot 60 = 120\)

### Step 5: Adding the Constant
After evaluating the multiplication combinations, we add 1 to each result:
- From all combinations, we only get \(120\). Thus, adding 1 gives us \(121\).

### Step 6: Finding Distinct Values
Since all combinations yield the same result of \(120\), the only distinct value we can obtain from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) is:
\[
121
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of distinct values that can be obtained from the expression by inserting parentheses is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\

For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To solve the problem of how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we need to consider the various features and their combinations. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Identify the Features and Their Options

1. **Hairstyles**: 3 options (plus the option to be bald, which adds 1 more option)
2. **Eyebrows**: 2 options
3. **Eyes**: 1 option (googly eyes)
4. **Ears**: 2 options
5. **Lips**: 2 options
6. **Shoes**: 2 options (1 pair of regular shoes and 1 pair of clown shoes)

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Options for Each Feature

- For hairstyles, since Mr. Potato Head can be bald, the total options for hairstyles is:
  \[
  \text{Total hairstyles} = 3 \text{ (hairstyles)} + 1 \text{ (bald)} = 4
  \]

- The options for the other features are as follows:
  - Eyebrows: 2
  - Eyes: 1
  - Ears: 2
  - Lips: 2
  - Shoes: 2

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Combinations

To find the total number of different personalities, we multiply the number of options for each feature together:
\[
\text{Total personalities} = (\text{Total hairstyles}) \times (\text{Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Eyes}) \times (\text{Ears}) \times (\text{Lips}) \times (\text{Shoes})
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:
\[
\text{Total personalities} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

### Step 4: Perform the Calculation

Now, we will perform the multiplication step-by-step:
1. \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. \(8 \times 1 = 8\)
3. \(8 \times 2 = 16\)
4. \(16 \times 2 = 32\)
5. \(32 \times 2 = 64\)

Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities Tom can create is:
\[
\text{Total personalities} = 64
\]

### Final Answer

The final answer, formatted in LaTeX notation, is:
\[
\boxed{64}
\]","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.012764549999999998
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To solve the problem of finding how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one '0', we can break down the solution step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define the Range
We are interested in whole numbers between 100 and 999, as these are the three-digit numbers. The range of numbers we will consider is from 100 to 999 inclusive.

### Step 2: Identify the Structure of Three-Digit Numbers
A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
- \(a\) is the hundreds place (can be from 1 to 9),
- \(b\) is the tens place (can be from 0 to 9),
- \(c\) is the units place (can be from 0 to 9).

### Step 3: Conditions for Exactly One '0'
To have exactly one '0' in the number \(abc\), we can have the following scenarios:
1. \(a = 1, 2, \ldots, 9\) (not '0'), \(b = 0\), \(c \neq 0\)
2. \(a = 1, 2, \ldots, 9\) (not '0'), \(b \neq 0\), \(c = 0\)

### Step 4: Count the Valid Combinations
#### Case 1: \(b = 0\)
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- Total for this case: \(9 \times 9 = 81\).

#### Case 2: \(c = 0\)
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(b\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- Total for this case: \(9 \times 9 = 81\).

### Step 5: Combine the Results
Now, we add the totals from both cases:
\[
81 + 81 = 162
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of whole numbers between 100 and 999 that contain exactly one '0' is:

\[
\boxed{162}
\]","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.011668499999999998
