        "model_output": "To solve the problem of finding a common English word with a product value of 715, we will follow a systematic approach. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Product Value\nEach letter in the English alphabet corresponds to a numerical value:\n- A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26.\n\nThe product value of a word is calculated by multiplying the values of its letters. For example, the word \"CAB\" has a product value of \\(3 \\times 1 \\times 2 = 6\\).\n\n### Step 2: Prime Factorization of 715\nTo find a word with a product value of 715, we first need to factor 715 into its prime components:\n- The prime factorization of 715 is:\n  \\[\n  715 = 5 \\times 11 \\times 13\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Mapping Prime Factors to Letters\nNext, we will map these prime factors to their corresponding letters:\n- 5 corresponds to E (5th letter),\n- 11 corresponds to K (11th letter),\n- 13 corresponds to M (13th letter).\n\n### Step 4: Forming the Word\nUsing the letters derived from the prime factors, we can form the word:\n- The letters are E, K, and M.\n\n### Step 5: Checking for Common English Words\nThe combination of letters E, K, and M can be rearranged to form the word \"MEK\", \"KEM\", or \"EKM\". However, none of these combinations are common English words. \n\n### Step 6: Exploring Other Combinations\nSince the product value can be achieved with different combinations of letters, we should also consider other combinations of letters that multiply to 715. \n\n### Step 7: Finding a Valid Word\nAfter checking various combinations, we find that the word \"ME\" (which has a product value of \\(13 \\times 5 = 65\\)) does not work. However, if we consider the letters corresponding to the factors:\n- 5 (E), 11 (K), and 13 (M) can be rearranged, but we need to check for other combinations.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter checking various combinations and ensuring that we are looking for common English words, we find that the word \"ME\" does not yield the correct product value. \n\nHowever, the word \"KEM\" is not a common English word either. \n\n### Final Answer\nThe common English word that has a product value of 715 is not straightforward from the prime factors alone. The prime factors lead us to letters E, K, and M, but they do not form a recognizable English word. \n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{No common English word found with a product value of 715.}\n\\] \n\nIf we were to state the product value itself, it would be:\n\\[\n\\boxed{715}\n\\] \n\nHowever, we conclude that there is no common English word that meets the criteria.",

        "question": "The expression $2\\cdot 3 \\cdot 4\\cdot 5+1$ is equal to 121, since multiplication is carried out before addition. However, we can obtain values other than 121 for this expression if we are allowed to change it by inserting parentheses. For example, we can obtain 144 by writing \\[\n(2\\cdot (3\\cdot 4)) \\cdot (5+1) = 144.\n\\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses?

        "right_answer": "By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\\cdot(3\\cdot 4))\\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors.
