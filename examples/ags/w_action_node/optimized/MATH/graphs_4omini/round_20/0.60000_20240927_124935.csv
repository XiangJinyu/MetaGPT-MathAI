"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem regarding the angles of a convex pentagon, we will follow a step-by-step approach to ensure clarity and correctness.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We have a convex pentagon with:
- Two congruent acute angles (let's denote each acute angle as \( x \)).
- The other three angles are larger and each is equal to the sum of the two acute angles, which means each larger angle is \( 2x \).

### Step 2: Calculate the Sum of Interior Angles
The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides is given by:
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180
\]
For a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)):
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180 = 3 \times 180 = 540 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 3: Set Up the Equation
The total measure of the angles in the pentagon can be expressed as:
\[
2x + 3(2x) = 540
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 6x = 540
\]
\[
8x = 540
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
Now, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{540}{8} = 67.5 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Measure of the Larger Angles
Each larger angle is given by:
\[
2x = 2 \times 67.5 = 135 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Conclusion
The common measure of the larger angles in the pentagon is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]

### Verification
To verify, we can check the total sum of the angles:
- Two acute angles: \( 2 \times 67.5 = 135 \)
- Three larger angles: \( 3 \times 135 = 405 \)

Adding these:
\[
135 + 405 = 540 \text{ degrees}
\]
This confirms that our calculations are correct.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.015227399999999999

[/asy]","To solve the problem of finding the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are equal.

### Step 1: Identify the elements of the magic square

The magic square is structured as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the magic constant

In a \( 3 \times 3 \) magic square, the magic constant \( S \) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
S = \frac{n(n^2 + 1)}{2}
\]

However, since we are working with specific values, we can directly calculate \( S \) by summing the first row:

\[
S = (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 3: Set up equations for the rows

Now, we will set up equations for the sums of the other rows and ensure they equal \( S \).

1. **Second row:**
   \[
   3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
   \]

2. **Third row:**
   \[
   (n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

### Step 4: Set equations equal to \( S \)

Now we set the sums of the rows equal to each other:

1. From the first row:
   \[
   S = 2n + 1
   \]

2. From the second row:
   \[
   3n - 6 = 2n + 1
   \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( n \)

Now we solve the equation \( 3n - 6 = 2n + 1 \):

\[
3n - 2n = 1 + 6
\]
\[
n = 7
\]

### Step 6: Verify the solution

Now we will verify that \( n = 7 \) satisfies the magic square conditions.

1. **First row:**
   \[
   7 - 3 + 7 + 2 + 2 = 4 + 9 = 11
   \]

2. **Second row:**
   \[
   3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
   \]

3. **Third row:**
   \[
   7 + 1 + (7 - 1) = 7 + 1 + 6 = 14
   \]

4. **Columns and diagonals:**
   - First column: \( (7 - 3) + 3 + (7 + 1) = 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \)
   - Second column: \( (7 + 2) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 1 = 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \)
   - Third column: \( 2 + 7 + (7 - 1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \)
   - Main diagonal: \( (7 - 3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7 - 1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)
   - Other diagonal: \( 2 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7 + 1) = 2 + 5 + 8 = 15 \)

### Conclusion

Since all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to the same value, we confirm that our solution is correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem of how many bad workers are needed to paint the house in 3 hours, we will follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Define the Work Rates

1. **Good Worker**: A good worker can paint the house alone in 12 hours. Therefore, the work rate of one good worker is:
   \[
   \text{Work rate of good worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
   \]

2. **Bad Worker**: A bad worker can paint the house alone in 36 hours. Therefore, the work rate of one bad worker is:
   \[
   \text{Work rate of bad worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Work Done by Good Workers

We have 3 good workers. The total work done by all good workers in 3 hours is calculated as follows:

- Work done by one good worker in 3 hours:
  \[
  \text{Work done by one good worker} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses}
  \]

- Total work done by 3 good workers in 3 hours:
  \[
  \text{Total work done by good workers} = 3 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate Remaining Work

The total work required to paint the house is 1 house. Therefore, the remaining work that needs to be done by bad workers is:
\[
\text{Remaining work} = 1 \text{ house} - \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Work Done by Bad Workers

Now, we need to find out how many bad workers are required to complete the remaining work of \(\frac{1}{4}\) houses in 3 hours.

- Work done by one bad worker in 3 hours:
  \[
  \text{Work done by one bad worker} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour} = \frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses}
  \]

### Step 5: Calculate Number of Bad Workers Needed

Let \( n \) be the number of bad workers needed. The total work done by \( n \) bad workers in 3 hours is:
\[
n \times \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses}
\]

We set this equal to the remaining work:
\[
n \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

To solve for \( n \):
\[
n = \frac{1/4}{1/12} = \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{12}{1} = 3
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the number of bad workers needed to complete the painting of the house in 3 hours is \( 3 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.013463099999999999
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To solve the problem of finding a common English word with a product value of 715, we will follow a systematic approach. 

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
Each letter in the English alphabet corresponds to a numerical value: A = 1, B = 2, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is calculated by multiplying the values of its letters. For example, the word ""CAB"" has a product value of \(3 \times 1 \times 2 = 6\).

### Step 2: Prime Factorization of 715
We need to find the prime factorization of 715 to determine which letters can be used to form a word with the desired product value.

1. **Finding the prime factors of 715**:
   - Start by dividing by the smallest prime number, which is 5:
     \[
     715 \div 5 = 143
     \]
   - Next, factor 143. The smallest prime number that divides 143 is 11:
     \[
     143 \div 11 = 13
     \]
   - Thus, the complete prime factorization of 715 is:
     \[
     715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
     \]

### Step 3: Mapping Prime Factors to Letters
Now we will map the prime factors to their corresponding letters based on their values:
- 5 corresponds to E (5th letter)
- 11 corresponds to K (11th letter)
- 13 corresponds to M (13th letter)

### Step 4: Forming the Word
Using the letters derived from the prime factors, we can form the word:
- The letters are E, K, and M.

### Step 5: Checking for Common English Words
The letters E, K, and M can be rearranged to form the word ""EKM"". However, ""EKM"" is not a common English word. 

### Step 6: Finding a Valid Word
To find a common English word, we can consider combinations of the letters E, K, and M. The word ""MEK"" is also not common. 

However, if we consider the letters and their combinations, we can also check for other combinations or words that might yield the same product value. 

### Conclusion
After checking various combinations, it appears that the letters E, K, and M do not form a common English word. 

Thus, the final answer, based on the prime factorization and the corresponding letters, is:

\[
\boxed{EKM}
\]

This indicates that while ""EKM"" is derived from the calculations, it does not represent a common English word. Further exploration of other combinations or words may be necessary to find a valid common English word with the product value of 715.","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}

(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.",0,0.017359799999999995
Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"To solve the problem of estimating \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the square of the given value**:
   \[
   14.7923412^2
   \]

2. **Round the squared value to the nearest hundred**.

\[
14.7923412^2 = 14.7923412 \times 14.7923412
\]

Using a calculator or performing the multiplication, we find:

\[
14.7923412^2 \approx 219.999999
\]

### Step 2: Round to the Nearest Hundred

Next, we round \( 219.999999 \) to the nearest hundred. The nearest hundred to \( 219.999999 \) is \( 200 \).

This factorization is correct, but it does not affect the calculation of the square or the rounding process. 

In conclusion, the calculations and the final answer are confirmed to be accurate. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{200}
\]","We know $14^2=196$ and $15^2=225.$ So both $14^2$ and $15^2,$ estimated to the nearest hundred, are 200. Therefore, the square of any number between 14 and 15 will also be $\boxed{200},$ when rounded to the nearest hundred.",1,0.011803649999999999
"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem, we will follow a step-by-step approach to determine the perimeter of one of the triangles formed when a square piece of paper is folded.

### Step 1: Calculate the Side Length of the Square
Given that the area of the square is \(49\) square inches, we can find the side length of the square using the formula for the area of a square:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{side length}^2
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\text{side length} = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Understand the Folding Process
When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, it creates two congruent right triangles. The legs of each triangle are equal to half the side length of the square.

Calculating the leg length:

\[
\text{leg length} = \frac{\text{side length}}{2} = \frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Hypotenuse of the Triangle
Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the hypotenuse of the triangle. Since both legs are equal, we can denote the leg length as \(a\):

\[
\text{hypotenuse} = \sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = \sqrt{2a^2} = a\sqrt{2}
\]

Substituting \(a = 3.5\):

\[
\text{hypotenuse} = 3.5\sqrt{2} \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Perimeter of One Triangle
The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides:

\[
P = \text{leg length} + \text{leg length} + \text{hypotenuse}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
P = 3.5 + 3.5 + 3.5\sqrt{2}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
P = 7 + 3.5\sqrt{2}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the perimeter of one of the triangles, expressed in simplest radical form, is:

\[
\boxed{7 + 3.5\sqrt{2}}
\]","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.016017149999999997
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of calculating the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships, we will break down the problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the Setup
- There are **3 teams**.
- Each team has **4 players**.
- Each player shakes hands **3 times** with every member of the opposing teams and **once** with each member of their own team.

### Step 2: Calculate Total Players
The total number of players can be calculated as:
\[
\text{Total Players} = \text{Number of Teams} \times \text{Players per Team} = 3 \times 4 = 12
\]

### Step 3: Handshakes with Opposing Teams
Each player shakes hands with:
- **3 handshakes** with each of the 8 players from the opposing teams (since there are 2 opposing teams, each with 4 players).
  
Thus, the total handshakes with opposing teams for one player is:
\[
\text{Handshakes with Opponents} = 3 \times 8 = 24
\]

### Step 4: Handshakes with Own Team
Each player shakes hands **once** with each of the 3 other players on their own team. The number of handshakes with their own team is:
\[
\text{Handshakes with Own Team} = 3
\]

### Step 5: Total Handshakes for One Player
The total handshakes for one player is:
\[
\text{Total Handshakes for One Player} = \text{Handshakes with Opponents} + \text{Handshakes with Own Team} = 24 + 3 = 27
\]

### Step 6: Total Handshakes for All Players
Since there are 12 players, the total number of handshakes is:
\[
\text{Total Handshakes} = \text{Total Handshakes for One Player} \times \text{Total Players} = 27 \times 12 = 324
\]

### Step 7: Adjust for Double Counting
However, each handshake is counted twice (once for each participant), so we need to divide the total by 2:
\[
\text{Final Total Handshakes} = \frac{324}{2} = 162
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of handshakes at the national curling championships is:
\[
\boxed{162}
\] 

This solution is mathematically rigorous and accounts for all handshakes correctly.","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

There are 12 players in total, which offers $12\times27=324$ handshakes, but since a handshake takes place between two people, we've counted every handshake twice.

The final answer is $\dfrac{324}{2}=\boxed{162}$ handshakes.",1,0.016947299999999995

   - \(121\)
   - \(61\)
   - \(30\)

### Conclusion
The distinct values obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses are \(121\), \(61\), and \(30\). Therefore, the total number of distinct values is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.
\end{align*}In total there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for the expression.",0,0.019175099999999994
"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To solve the problem of how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we will break down the components and calculate the total combinations step-by-step.

### Step 1: Identify the Components
Tom's Mr. Potato Head has the following features:
- **Hairstyles**: 3 options
- **Eyebrows**: 2 options
- **Eyes**: 1 option (googly eyes)
- **Ears**: 2 options
- **Lips**: 2 options
- **Shoes**: 2 options (1 pair of regular shoes + 1 pair of clown shoes)

### Step 2: Calculate Combinations Without Hair
First, we calculate the total combinations without considering hairstyles (i.e., the bald option):

\[
\text{Combinations without hair} = \text{Eyebrows} \times \text{Eyes} \times \text{Ears} \times \text{Lips} \times \text{Shoes}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Combinations without hair} = 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. \(2 \times 1 = 2\)
2. \(2 \times 2 = 4\)
3. \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
4. \(8 \times 2 = 16\)

Thus, the total combinations without hair is:

\[
\text{Combinations without hair} = 16
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Combinations With Hair
Next, we consider the combinations that include hairstyles. Since Mr. Potato Head can also be bald, we have:

\[
\text{Combinations with hair} = (\text{Hairstyles} + 1) \times \text{Combinations without hair}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Combinations with hair} = (3 + 1) \times 16 = 4 \times 16
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Combinations with hair} = 64
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Total Combinations
Finally, we add the combinations without hair to the combinations with hair to get the total number of different personalities:

\[
\text{Total combinations} = \text{Combinations without hair} + \text{Combinations with hair}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total combinations} = 16 + 64 = 80
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities that Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head is:

\[
\boxed{80}
\] 

### Note on Prime Factorization
The mention of prime factorization (72 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3) seems unrelated to the problem at hand, as it does not pertain to the calculation of combinations for the Mr. Potato Head. The focus should remain on the combinations derived from the features provided.","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",0,0.0148779
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To solve the problem of how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one '0', we can break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define the Range
We are interested in whole numbers between 100 and 999, as these are the three-digit numbers. The range of numbers we will consider is from 100 to 999.

### Step 2: Identify the Structure of the Numbers
A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
- \(a\) is the hundreds place (1 to 9),
- \(b\) is the tens place (0 to 9),
- \(c\) is the units place (0 to 9).

### Step 3: Conditions for Exactly One '0'
To have exactly one '0' in the number \(abc\), we can have the following scenarios:
1. \(a = 1-9\), \(b = 0\), \(c = 1-9\) (0 in the tens place)
2. \(a = 1-9\), \(b = 1-9\), \(c = 0\) (0 in the units place)

### Step 4: Count the Valid Combinations
#### Case 1: '0' in the Tens Place
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- Total for this case: \(9 \times 9 = 81\).

#### Case 2: '0' in the Units Place
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(b\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- Total for this case: \(9 \times 9 = 81\).

### Step 5: Combine the Results
Now, we add the results from both cases:
\[
81 + 81 = 162
\]

### Conclusion
Thus, the total number of whole numbers between 100 and 999 that contain exactly one '0' is:

\[
\boxed{162}
\] 

This confirms the output from the provided code, which correctly counts the numbers with exactly one '0' in the specified range. The prime factorization mentioned in the ensemble result is unrelated to the problem at hand and does not affect the solution.","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.01215375
