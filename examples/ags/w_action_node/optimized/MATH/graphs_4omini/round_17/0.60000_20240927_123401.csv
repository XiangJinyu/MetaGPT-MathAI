"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Review the problem statement**: We have a convex pentagon with two congruent acute angles, and the other three angles are equal to the sum of the two acute angles.

2. **Logical errors or misinterpretations**: 
   - Let the measure of each acute angle be \(x\). Therefore, the two acute angles together measure \(2x\).
   - The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula \( (n-2) \times 180^\circ \), where \(n\) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, \(n = 5\), so the sum is \(3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ\).
   - The three larger angles, each denoted as \(y\), must satisfy the equation: 
     \[
     2x + 3y = 540^\circ
     \]
   - Additionally, since each of the larger angles is equal to the sum of the two acute angles, we have:
     \[
     y = 2x
     \]

3. **Verify the solution addresses all parts**: 
   - Substitute \(y = 2x\) into the first equation:
     \[
     2x + 3(2x) = 540^\circ
     \]
     \[
     2x + 6x = 540^\circ
     \]
     \[
     8x = 540^\circ
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
     \]
   - Now, substituting back to find \(y\):
     \[
     y = 2x = 2(67.5^\circ) = 135^\circ
     \]

4. **Ensure the answer is expressed in the required form**: The final answer is \(y = 135^\circ\), which is already in the correct form.

5. **Check for formatting issues in LaTeX notation**: The final answer is correctly formatted as \(\boxed{135}\).

After reviewing all steps, the final solution is confirmed to be correct. 

Final answer: \(\boxed{135}\)","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.024387899999999994

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: The problem involves a 3x3 magic square with variables. The goal is to find the value of \( n \) such that the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals are equal.

2. **Check for Logical Errors**: 
   - The entries of the magic square are:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
     3 & 2n-9 & n \\
     n+1 & 1 & n-1
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - The sum of the first row is:
     \[
     (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 2n + 1
     \]
   - The sum of the second row is:
     \[
     3 + (2n-9) + n = 3n - 6
     \]
   - The sum of the third row is:
     \[
     (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = 2n + 1
     \]

   For the magic square property, all rows must equal the same sum. Thus, we set the sums equal:
   \[
   2n + 1 = 3n - 6
   \]
   Solving this gives:
   \[
   2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \implies 1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n
   \]

3. **Verify that the Solution Addresses All Parts**: 
   - We need to check if the columns and diagonals also yield the same sum when \( n = 7 \).
   - The sums of the columns:
     - First column: \( (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = (7-3) + 3 + (7+1) = 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \)
     - Second column: \( (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = (7+2) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 1 = 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \)
     - Third column: \( 2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + 7 + (7-1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \)

   - The sums of the diagonals:
     - Main diagonal: \( (n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = (7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)
     - Other diagonal: \( 2 + (2n-9) + (n+1) = 2 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7+1) = 2 + 5 + 8 = 15 \)

   All rows, columns, and diagonals sum to 15 when \( n = 7 \).

5. **Check for Formatting Issues in LaTeX Notation**: The final answer is correctly formatted.

Since all checks confirm the correctness of the solution, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have good workers who can paint the house in 12 hours and bad workers who can do it in 36 hours. We need the house painted in 3 hours with 3 good workers and some bad workers.

2. **Logical Errors or Misinterpretations**: 
   - The rate of work for good workers is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of the house per hour.
   - The rate of work for bad workers is \( \frac{1}{36} \) of the house per hour.
   - With 3 good workers, their combined rate is \( 3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the house per hour.

3. **Addressing All Parts of the Question**: 
   - Let \( b \) be the number of bad workers. Their combined rate is \( b \times \frac{1}{36} \).
   - The total rate of work must equal the rate needed to finish the house in 3 hours, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the house per hour.

4. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} + b \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

5. **Solving the Equation**:
   - First, find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 4, 36, and 3 is 36.
   - Rewrite the equation:
   \[
   \frac{9}{36} + \frac{b}{36} = \frac{12}{36}
   \]
   - Combine the fractions:
   \[
   9 + b = 12
   \]
   - Solve for \( b \):
   \[
   b = 12 - 9 = 3
   \]

6. **Final Answer**: The number of bad workers needed is 3, not 9.

Thus, the corrected final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.

Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.026932649999999992
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","Let's analyze the problem and the final solution step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: The task is to find a common English word whose letters' product values equal 715, where A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26.

2. **Logical Errors or Misinterpretations**: The product value of a word is calculated by multiplying the values of its letters. We need to check if 715 can be expressed as a product of letter values.

3. **Verification of Solution**: The final solution states that no common English word was found with a product value of 715. We need to verify if this is indeed the case.

4. **Calculation of Factors**: The prime factorization of 715 is:
   \[
   715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
   \]
   Each of these factors corresponds to letters:
   - 5 = E
   - 11 = K
   - 13 = M

   Therefore, the word ""EKM"" has a product value of \(5 \times 11 \times 13 = 715\). However, ""EKM"" is not a common English word.

5. **Exploring Other Combinations**: We can also check combinations of letters that yield 715. For example, we can try combinations of letters that multiply to 715, but they must form a recognizable word.

6. **Conclusion**: After checking the factors and possible combinations, it appears that while we can find combinations of letters that yield 715, they do not form a common English word.

Thus, the final solution remains correct. 

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{No common English word found with a product value of 715.}}
\]","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}
(5)\cdot (11) \cdot (13) &= 5\cdot 11\cdot 13 \\
(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.",0,0.02719889999999999

   - Now, calculating \( 15^2 \) gives us \( 225 \).

4. **Addressing All Parts of the Question**: The solution does not address the estimation correctly. The nearest hundred to \( 225 \) is \( 200 \), but the calculation leading to that conclusion was incorrect.

5. **Formatting Issues**: The final answer is correctly formatted in LaTeX.

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have a square piece of paper with an area of \(49\) square inches. This means the side length of the square is \(s = \sqrt{49} = 7\) inches. When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, two congruent triangles are formed.

2. **Logical Errors or Misinterpretations**: The folding of the square creates two right triangles. Each triangle has legs that are half the side length of the square. The legs of each triangle will be \( \frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \) inches.

3. **Area and Triangle Dimensions**: The hypotenuse of each triangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   c = \sqrt{(3.5)^2 + (3.5)^2} = \sqrt{12.25 + 12.25} = \sqrt{24.5} = \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}

4. **Perimeter Calculation**: The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle is given by the sum of the lengths of its three sides:
   \[
   P = 3.5 + 3.5 + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2} = 7 + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}

How many handshakes are there in total?","Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have three teams of four players each. Each player shakes hands three times with every member of the opposing teams and once with each member of their own team.

2. **Logical Errors or Misinterpretations**: 
   - Each team has 4 players, and there are 3 teams, so the total number of players is \(3 \times 4 = 12\).
   - Each player shakes hands with their own team members once, which means each player shakes hands with 3 other players from their own team.
   - Each player shakes hands with members of the other two teams three times.

3. **Solution Addressing All Parts**:
   - **Own Team Handshakes**: Each player shakes hands with 3 members of their own team once, leading to \(4 \text{ players} \times 3 \text{ handshakes} = 12\) handshakes per team. Since there are 3 teams, this results in \(3 \times 12 = 36\) handshakes among the teams.
   - **Opposing Teams Handshakes**: Each player shakes hands with 8 players from the other two teams (4 players from each team) three times. Thus, each player has \(8 \times 3 = 24\) handshakes with opposing team members. For all 12 players, this results in \(12 \times 24 = 288\) handshakes.

4. **Total Handshakes Calculation**:
   - Total handshakes = Handshakes among own teams + Handshakes with opposing teams
   - Total handshakes = \(36 + 288 = 324\).

5. **Final Answer Formatting**: The final answer should be expressed in LaTeX notation.

- \( (2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 + 1 = (2 \cdot 12) \cdot 5 + 1 = 60 + 1 = 61 \)
- \( 2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) + 1 = 2 \cdot 60 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121 \)
- \( 2 \cdot ((3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5) + 1 = 2 \cdot 60 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121 \)

1. **Review the problem statement**: Tom has various components for Mr. Potato Head, and we need to calculate the total number of different combinations of these components, including the option to be bald (no hair).

2. **Identify components**:
   - Hairstyles: 3 options (including bald)
   - Eyebrows: 2 options
   - Eyes: 1 option
   - Ears: 2 options
   - Lips: 2 options
   - Shoes: 2 options (regular and clown)

3. **Logical interpretation**: Each component can be chosen independently, and the bald option means that for hairstyles, we have 4 choices (3 hairstyles + 1 bald).

4. **Calculate combinations**:
   - Total choices for hairstyles: \(3 + 1 = 4\)
   - Total choices for eyebrows: \(2\)
   - Total choices for eyes: \(1\)
   - Total choices for ears: \(2\)
   - Total choices for lips: \(2\)
   - Total choices for shoes: \(2\)

   The total number of combinations can be calculated by multiplying the number of choices for each component:
