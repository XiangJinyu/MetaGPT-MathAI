"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem regarding the angles of a convex pentagon, we will follow a step-by-step approach to ensure clarity and correctness.

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
We have a convex pentagon with:
- Two congruent acute angles, which we will denote as \( x \).
- Three other angles, each equal to the sum of the two acute angles, which is \( 2x \).

### Step 2: Sum of Interior Angles
The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180
\]
where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)):
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180 = 3 \times 180 = 540 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 3: Setting Up the Equation
From the problem, we can express the total sum of the angles in terms of \( x \):
- The two acute angles contribute \( 2x \).
- The three larger angles contribute \( 3(2x) = 6x \).

Thus, the equation for the sum of the angles is:
\[
2x + 6x = 540
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
8x = 540
\]

### Step 4: Solving for \( x \)
Now, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{540}{8} = 67.5 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 5: Finding the Measure of the Large Angles
The measure of each of the larger angles is:
\[
2x = 2 \times 67.5 = 135 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]

### Verification of the Code
The code provided in the ensemble result correctly implements the steps we outlined. The calculation of \( x \) and the subsequent calculation of the large angle are accurate. The output of \( 135.0 \) is indeed correct, confirming that the solution is valid. 

### Prime Factorization
The prime factorization of \( 135 \) is \( 3^3 \times 5 \), which does not relate to the problem but is noted for completeness. 

In conclusion, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.013903200000000001

[/asy]","To solve the problem of finding the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we will follow a systematic approach by calculating the sums of each row and setting them equal to each other, as required by the properties of a magic square.

### Step 1: Define the Rows
The magic square is defined as follows:

- **Row 1:** \( n - 3, n + 2, 2 \)
- **Row 2:** \( 3, 2n - 9, n \)
- **Row 3:** \( n + 1, 1, n - 1 \)

### Step 2: Calculate the Sums of Each Row
We will calculate the sum of each row:

1. **Sum of Row 1:**
   \[
   S_1 = (n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
   \]

2. **Sum of Row 2:**
   \[
   S_2 = 3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
   \]

3. **Sum of Row 3:**
   \[
   S_3 = (n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

### Step 3: Set the Sums Equal
Since this is a magic square, the sums of the rows must be equal. We can set \( S_1 \) equal to \( S_2 \):

\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( n \)
Rearranging the equation gives:

\[
2n + 1 + 6 = 3n
\]
\[
7 = 3n - 2n
\]
\[
n = 7
\]

### Step 5: Verify the Value of \( n \)
Now we will verify if \( n = 7 \) satisfies the magic square property by calculating the sums of all rows with \( n = 7 \):

1. **Row 1:**
   \[
   7 - 3, 7 + 2, 2 \Rightarrow 4, 9, 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
   \]

2. **Row 2:**
   \[
   3, 2(7) - 9, 7 \Rightarrow 3, 14 - 9, 7 \Rightarrow 3, 5, 7 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
   \]

3. **Row 3:**
   \[
   7 + 1, 1, 7 - 1 \Rightarrow 8, 1, 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
   \]

### Conclusion
All rows sum to 15, confirming that the magic square property holds true for \( n = 7 \).

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem of how many bad workers are needed to paint the house in 3 hours, we will follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Define the Work Rates

1. **Good Worker**: A good worker can paint the house in 12 hours. Therefore, the work rate of one good worker is:
   \[
   \text{Work rate of good worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
   \]

2. **Bad Worker**: A bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours. Therefore, the work rate of one bad worker is:
   \[
   \text{Work rate of bad worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Work Done by Good Workers

We have 3 good workers. The total work done by these good workers in 3 hours is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Total work by good workers} = \text{Number of good workers} \times \text{Work rate of good worker} \times \text{Time}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Total work by good workers} = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} \times 3 = \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ of the house}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Remaining Work

The total work required to paint the house is 1 (the whole house). The remaining work after the good workers have done their part is:
\[
\text{Remaining work} = 1 - \text{Total work by good workers} = 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the house}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Number of Bad Workers Needed

Let \( x \) be the number of bad workers needed to complete the remaining work in the given time. The equation for the work done by the bad workers in 3 hours is:
\[
x \times \text{Work rate of bad worker} \times \text{Time} = \text{Remaining work}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
x \times \frac{1}{36} \times 3 = \frac{1}{4}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x \times \frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{4}
\]
\[
x \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
\]
Now, solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{1/4}{1/12} = \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{12}{1} = 3
\]

### Step 5: Conclusion

Thus, the number of bad workers needed to ensure the house is painted in 3 hours is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\] 

This means you need to find 3 bad workers in addition to the 3 good workers to complete the painting of the house on time.","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.0153366
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To solve the problem of finding a common English word with a product value of 715, we first need to understand the prime factorization of the target product value and how it relates to the letter values.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization
The prime factorization of 715 is given as:
\[
715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
\]

### Step 2: Mapping Prime Factors to Letter Values
Next, we need to map these prime factors to the corresponding letter values based on the A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26 mapping:
- The letter value for 5 corresponds to **E** (5).
- The letter value for 11 corresponds to **K** (11).
- The letter value for 13 corresponds to **M** (13).

### Step 3: Forming Words
Now, we can form words using the letters E, K, and M. The combinations of these letters can yield the following words:
- **E** (5)
- **K** (11)
- **M** (13)
- **ME** (13 × 5 = 65)
- **KE** (11 × 5 = 55)
- **EM** (5 × 13 = 65)
- **EKM** (5 × 11 × 13 = 715)

However, we need to check if any of these combinations form common English words.

### Step 4: Checking Common Words
From the list of common English words provided in the code:
- ""CAB""
- ""BAD""
- ""DAD""
- ""ACE""
- ""BEE""
- ""FAD""
- ""FACE""
- ""CAGE""
- ""BAG""
- ""DEED""
- ""FED""
- ""FAD""
- ""BEAD""
- ""CAFE""
- ""CABBAGE""
- ""BEEHIVE""
- ""DECADE""

We can calculate the product values for these words to see if any match 715.

### Step 5: Calculating Product Values
Let's calculate the product values for the relevant words:
- **CABBAGE**: 
  - C = 3, A = 1, B = 2, B = 2, A = 1, G = 7, E = 5
  - Product = \(3 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 1 \times 7 \times 5 = 420\)
  
- **BEEHIVE**: 
  - B = 2, E = 5, E = 5, H = 8, I = 9, V = 22, E = 5
  - Product = \(2 \times 5 \times 5 \times 8 \times 9 \times 22 \times 5 = 8800\)

- **DECADE**: 
  - D = 4, E = 5, C = 3, A = 1, D = 4, E = 5
  - Product = \(4 \times 5 \times 3 \times 1 \times 4 \times 5 = 600\)

After checking all the words, none of the provided words yield a product value of 715.

### Step 6: Conclusion
Since none of the common words in the provided list yield a product value of 715, we conclude that there may not be a common English word that meets the criteria based on the provided list.

However, if we consider the letters E, K, and M, we can form the word ""MEK"" or ""KE"" but these are not common English words.

Thus, the final answer is that there is no common English word with a product value of 715 from the provided list.

The final answer is:
\[
\text{No common English word found with a product value of } 715.
\]","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}
(5)\cdot (11) \cdot (13) &= 5\cdot 11\cdot 13 \\
(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.

Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"To solve the problem of estimating \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the square of the number**: We need to compute \( 14.7923412^2 \).
2. **Round the result to the nearest hundred**: After calculating the square, we will round the result to the nearest hundred.
3. **Verify the calculations**: Ensure that all calculations are correct and identify any errors in the provided code or output.

### Step 1: Calculate the Square

We start by calculating \( 14.7923412^2 \):

\[
14.7923412^2 = 14.7923412 \times 14.7923412
\]

Using a calculator or performing the multiplication:

\[
14.7923412^2 \approx 219.999999
\]

### Step 2: Round to the Nearest Hundred

Next, we round \( 219.999999 \) to the nearest hundred. The nearest hundred to \( 219.999999 \) is \( 200 \).

### Step 3: Verify the Calculations

Now, let's verify the calculations step-by-step:

1. **Square Calculation**:
   \[
   14.7923412^2 \approx 219.999999
   \]

2. **Rounding**:
   - The value \( 219.999999 \) rounded to the nearest hundred is indeed \( 200 \).

### Final Answer

The final answer, after performing the calculations and rounding, is:

\[
\boxed{200}
\]

### Review of the Ensemble Result

The ensemble result provided in the code correctly calculates the square and rounds it to the nearest hundred. The output of \( 200.0 \) is accurate, and there are no errors in the code or its output. 

### Prime Factorization

The prime factors listed as [2, 7, 11] do not relate to the final answer of \( 200 \) since the prime factorization of \( 200 \) is \( 2^3 \times 5^2 \). However, this does not affect the correctness of the main calculation and rounding process. 

Thus, the final answer remains:

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem, we need to analyze the situation step-by-step, ensuring all calculations are correct and the final answer is expressed in the required format.

### Step 1: Determine the Side Length of the Square
The area of the square is given as \(49\) square inches. The formula for the area of a square is:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{side length}^2
\]

Let \(s\) be the side length of the square. We can find \(s\) by taking the square root of the area:

\[
s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Understand the Folding of the Square
When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, it creates two congruent right triangles. The base of each triangle is half the side length of the square, and the height is the full side length of the square.

### Step 3: Calculate the Base and Height of the Triangle
- **Base** of the triangle:

\[
\text{Base} = \frac{s}{2} = \frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \text{ inches}
\]

- **Height** of the triangle:

\[
\text{Height} = s = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Hypotenuse of the Triangle
Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the hypotenuse \(h\) of the triangle:

\[
h = \sqrt{(\text{Base})^2 + (\text{Height})^2} = \sqrt{(3.5)^2 + (7)^2}
\]

Calculating the squares:

\[
(3.5)^2 = 12.25
\]
\[
(7)^2 = 49
\]

Now, adding these:

\[
h = \sqrt{12.25 + 49} = \sqrt{61.25}
\]

To express \(61.25\) in a simpler form, we can write it as:

\[
61.25 = \frac{245}{4}
\]

Thus,

\[
h = \sqrt{\frac{245}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{245}}{2}
\]

### Step 5: Simplify \(\sqrt{245}\)
The prime factorization of \(245\) is:

\[
245 = 5 \times 7^2
\]

Thus,

\[
\sqrt{245} = \sqrt{5 \times 7^2} = 7\sqrt{5}
\]

So, the hypotenuse becomes:

\[
h = \frac{7\sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the Perimeter of One Triangle
The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle is the sum of its base, height, and hypotenuse:

\[
P = \text{Base} + \text{Height} + \text{Hypotenuse}
\]

Substituting the values we found:

\[
P = 3.5 + 7 + \frac{7\sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

Converting \(3.5\) to a fraction:

\[
3.5 = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Now, we can combine the terms:

\[
P = \frac{7}{2} + \frac{14}{2} + \frac{7\sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{7 + 14 + 7\sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{21 + 7\sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the perimeter of one of the triangles, expressed in simplest radical form, is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{21 + 7\sqrt{5}}{2}}
\]","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.016457250000000003
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of calculating the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships, we will break down the steps clearly and ensure all calculations are correct.

### Step 1: Understand the Setup
- There are **3 teams**.
- Each team has **4 players**.
- Each player shakes hands **3 times** with every member of the opposing teams and **once** with each member of their own team.

### Step 2: Calculate Total Players
The total number of players in the championship can be calculated as:
\[
\text{Total Players} = \text{Number of Teams} \times \text{Players per Team} = 3 \times 4 = 12
\]

### Step 3: Handshakes with Opposing Teams
Each player shakes hands with:
- **3 handshakes** with each member of the opposing teams.
- There are **2 opposing teams** (since a player does not shake hands with their own team).

Thus, the total number of handshakes with opposing teams for one player is:
\[
\text{Handshakes with Opponents} = \text{Number of Opposing Teams} \times \text{Players per Team} \times \text{Handshakes per Opponent} = 2 \times 4 \times 3 = 24
\]

### Step 4: Handshakes with Own Team
Each player shakes hands **once** with each of the other **3 players** on their own team:
\[
\text{Handshakes with Own Team} = 3
\]

### Step 5: Total Handshakes per Player
Now, we can calculate the total handshakes for one player:
\[
\text{Total Handshakes per Player} = \text{Handshakes with Opponents} + \text{Handshakes with Own Team} = 24 + 3 = 27
\]

### Step 6: Total Handshakes in the Championship
To find the total number of handshakes in the championship, we multiply the total handshakes per player by the total number of players:
\[
\text{Total Handshakes} = \text{Total Players} \times \text{Total Handshakes per Player} = 12 \times 27 = 324
\]

### Step 7: Adjust for Double Counting
Since each handshake involves two players, we have counted each handshake twice. Therefore, we need to divide the total by 2:
\[
\text{Final Total Handshakes} = \frac{324}{2} = 162
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of handshakes at the national curling championships is:
\[
\boxed{162}
\]

### Prime Factorization
The prime factors provided ([2, 3, 5, 7]) do not relate to the final answer of 162, which has the prime factorization of \(2 \times 3^4\). Thus, the prime factors listed are not relevant to the final answer.","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

(2\cdot (3\cdot 4)) \cdot (5+1) = 144.
\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).","To solve the problem of how many distinct values can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses, we will systematically explore the different ways to group the terms using parentheses.

### Step 1: Understanding the Expression
The original expression is:
\[
2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1
\]
Calculating the product without parentheses gives:
\[
2 \cdot 3 = 6, \quad 6 \cdot 4 = 24, \quad 24 \cdot 5 = 120
\]
Thus, the expression evaluates to:
\[
120 + 1 = 121
\]

### Step 2: Inserting Parentheses
We can insert parentheses in various ways to change the order of operations. The key is to consider all possible groupings of the four numbers \(2\), \(3\), \(4\), and \(5\). 

Here are the different ways to insert parentheses:

1. **No parentheses**:
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 121
   \]

2. **Two pairs**:
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 6 \cdot 20 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \((2 \cdot 4) \cdot (3 \cdot 5) + 1 = 8 \cdot 15 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \((2 \cdot 5) \cdot (3 \cdot 4) + 1 = 10 \cdot 12 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)

3. **Three terms grouped**:
   - \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 24 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \((2 \cdot 4) \cdot 3 \cdot 5 + 1 = 8 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \((2 \cdot 5) \cdot 3 \cdot 4 + 1 = 10 \cdot 12 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)

4. **All terms grouped**:
   - \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5))) + 1 = (2 \cdot 60) + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \((2 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) \cdot 3 + 1 = (2 \cdot 20) \cdot 3 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \((3 \cdot (4 \cdot (2 \cdot 5))) + 1 = (3 \cdot 40) + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)

5. **Mixed operations**:
   - \((2 + (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5)) + 1 = (2 + 60) + 1 = 63\)
   - \((3 + (4 \cdot 5 \cdot 2)) + 1 = (3 + 40) + 1 = 44\)
   - \((4 + (5 \cdot 2 \cdot 3)) + 1 = (4 + 30) + 1 = 35\)
   - \((5 + (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4)) + 1 = (5 + 24) + 1 = 30\)

### Step 3: Collecting Distinct Values
From the calculations above, we can summarize the distinct values obtained:
- \(121\) (from multiple configurations)
- \(63\)
- \(44\)
- \(35\)
- \(30\)

### Step 4: Counting Distinct Values
The distinct values we have are:
- \(121\)
- \(63\)
- \(44\)
- \(35\)
- \(30\)

Thus, the total number of distinct values that can be obtained by inserting parentheses is \(5\).

### Final Answer
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.
\end{align*}In total there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for the expression.",0,0.017182350000000002
"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To solve the problem of how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we need to consider the various features and their combinations. Let's break down the solution step-by-step.

### Step 1: Identify the Features and Their Options
1. **Hairstyles**: 3 options (plus 1 option for being bald)
2. **Eyebrows**: 2 options
3. **Eyes**: 1 option (googly eyes)
4. **Ears**: 2 options
5. **Lips**: 2 options
6. **Shoes**: 2 options (1 pair of regular shoes + 1 pair of clown shoes)

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Options for Each Feature
- **Total Hairstyles**: Since Mr. Potato Head can be bald, we have:
  \[
  \text{Total Hairstyles} = 3 + 1 = 4
  \]
- **Total Eyebrows**: 2
- **Total Eyes**: 1
- **Total Ears**: 2
- **Total Lips**: 2
- **Total Shoes**: 2

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Combinations
To find the total number of different personalities, we multiply the number of options for each feature:
\[
\text{Total Personalities} = (\text{Total Hairstyles}) \times (\text{Total Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Total Eyes}) \times (\text{Total Ears}) \times (\text{Total Lips}) \times (\text{Total Shoes})
\]
Substituting the values we calculated:
\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

### Step 4: Perform the Calculation
Now, we perform the multiplication step-by-step:
1. \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. \(8 \times 1 = 8\)
3. \(8 \times 2 = 16\)
4. \(16 \times 2 = 32\)
5. \(32 \times 2 = 64\)

Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities Tom can create is:
\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 64
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the Target Product Value
The target product value is given as 72, with a prime factorization of \([2, 2, 2, 3, 3]\). However, our calculated total of 64 does not match this target. 

### Conclusion
The calculations are correct based on the features provided. The total number of different wacky personalities Tom can create is:
\[
\boxed{64}
\] 

The prime factorization of 64 is \([2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\), which does not match the prime factorization of 72. Therefore, the target product value of 72 is not relevant to the solution of the problem as posed.","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.0143709
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To solve the problem of counting how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one '0', we can break down the solution step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define the Range
We are interested in whole numbers between 100 and 999 (inclusive). This is because the problem specifies numbers between 99 and 999, and the smallest three-digit number is 100.

### Step 2: Identify the Structure of the Numbers
A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
- \(a\) is the hundreds place (can be from 1 to 9),
- \(b\) is the tens place (can be from 0 to 9),
- \(c\) is the units place (can be from 0 to 9).

### Step 3: Conditions for Exactly One '0'
For a number to contain exactly one '0', we can have the following scenarios:
1. The '0' is in the tens place: \(a0c\)
2. The '0' is in the units place: \(ab0\)

### Step 4: Count Valid Combinations
#### Case 1: '0' in the Tens Place (a0c)
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be '0' to satisfy the condition of having exactly one '0') (9 options).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \times 9 = 81
\]

#### Case 2: '0' in the Units Place (ab0)
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(b\) can be any digit from 0 to 9, but it cannot be '0' (to satisfy the condition of having exactly one '0') (10 options).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \times 10 = 90
\]

### Step 5: Combine the Counts
Now, we add the counts from both cases:
\[
81 + 90 = 171
\]

### Final Answer
The total number of whole numbers between 99 and 999 that contain exactly one '0' is:
\[
\boxed{171}
\]","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",0,0.01353375
