"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We have a convex pentagon with:
- Two congruent acute angles (let's denote each of these angles as \( x \)).
- Three other angles, each equal to the sum of the two acute angles.

### Step 2: Identify Key Information and Unknowns
- Let the two acute angles be \( x \).
- The measure of each of the other three angles is \( 2x \) (since each is equal to the sum of the two acute angles, \( x + x = 2x \)).
- We need to find the common measure of the large angles, which is \( 2x \).

### Step 3: Choose an Appropriate Method or Formula
The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
\]
where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, \( n = 5 \):
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
\]

### Step 4: Set Up the Equation
The total sum of the angles in the pentagon can be expressed as:
\[
x + x + 2x + 2x + 2x = 540^\circ
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 6x = 540^\circ
\]
\[
8x = 540^\circ
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
Now, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
\]

### Step 6: Find the Measure of the Large Angles
The measure of each of the large angles is:
\[
2x = 2 \times 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ
\]

### Step 7: Double-Check Calculations
- The two acute angles are \( 67.5^\circ \) each.
- The three large angles are \( 135^\circ \) each.
- The total sum of the angles is:
\[
2(67.5^\circ) + 3(135^\circ) = 135^\circ + 405^\circ = 540^\circ
\]
This confirms our calculations are correct.

### Final Answer
The common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is \( \boxed{135} \) degrees.","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.011725349999999999

[/asy]","To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \( n \) in the given magic square. A magic square is defined such that the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are equal.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We have a 3x3 magic square with the following entries:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 2: Identify Key Information and Unknowns
The unknown is \( n \). We need to find the common sum of the rows, columns, and diagonals.

### Step 3: Choose a Method
We will calculate the sum of the first row and set it equal to the sum of the second row and the third row. We will also check the sums of the columns and diagonals.

### Step 4: Solve the Problem Step by Step

1. **Calculate the sum of the first row:**
   \[
   (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
   \]

2. **Calculate the sum of the second row:**
   \[
   3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the sum of the third row:**
   \[
   (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

4. **Set the sums of the rows equal:**
   Since the first and third rows both sum to \( 2n + 1 \), we can set the second row equal to this:
   \[
   3n - 6 = 2n + 1
   \]

5. **Solve for \( n \):**
   \[
   3n - 2n = 1 + 6
   \]
   \[
   n = 7
   \]

### Step 5: Double-Check Calculations
Now we will verify that \( n = 7 \) satisfies the magic square condition.

1. **Substituting \( n = 7 \) into the square:**
   \[
   \begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
   \hline
   4 & 9 & 2 \\
   \hline
   3 & 5 & 7 \\
   \hline
   8 & 1 & 6 \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   \]

2. **Check the sums:**
   - First row: \( 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \)
   - Second row: \( 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \)
   - Third row: \( 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \)
   - First column: \( 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \)
   - Second column: \( 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \)
   - Third column: \( 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \)
   - Diagonal (top-left to bottom-right): \( 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)
   - Diagonal (top-right to bottom-left): \( 2 + 5 + 8 = 15 \)

All sums equal 15, confirming that our solution is correct.

### Final Answer
The value of \( n \) is \( \boxed{7} \).","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem, let's follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to determine how many bad workers are required to help 3 good workers paint a house in 3 hours. 

### Step 2: Identify Key Information and Unknowns
- Each good worker can paint the house in 12 hours.
- Each bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours.
- We have 3 good workers.
- We need the house painted in 3 hours.

### Step 3: Choose an Appropriate Method
We will calculate the work done by the good workers and then determine how much more work is needed from the bad workers to complete the task in the required time.

### Step 4: Solve the Problem Step by Step

1. **Calculate the work rate of good workers:**
   - A good worker's rate is \( \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour} \).
   - Therefore, 3 good workers' combined rate is:
     \[
     3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses per hour}.
     \]

2. **Calculate the total work needed:**
   - The total work to paint 1 house is 1 house.

3. **Calculate the total work done by good workers in 3 hours:**
   - In 3 hours, the work done by the 3 good workers is:
     \[
     \text{Work by good workers} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses}.
     \]

4. **Determine the remaining work:**
   - The remaining work to be done after the good workers is:
     \[
     1 \text{ house} - \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses}.
     \]

5. **Calculate the work rate of bad workers:**
   - A bad worker's rate is \( \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour} \).

6. **Let \( x \) be the number of bad workers needed.**
   - The combined rate of \( x \) bad workers is:
     \[
     x \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{x}{36} \text{ houses per hour}.
     \]

7. **Set up the equation for the total work done in 3 hours:**
   - The total work done by \( x \) bad workers in 3 hours is:
     \[
     \text{Work by bad workers} = \frac{x}{36} \times 3 = \frac{3x}{36} = \frac{x}{12} \text{ houses}.
     \]
   - We need this to equal the remaining work:
     \[
     \frac{x}{12} = \frac{1}{4}.
     \]

8. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 12:
     \[
     x = 12 \times \frac{1}{4} = 3.
     \]

### Step 5: Double-Check Calculations
- The work done by 3 good workers in 3 hours is \( \frac{3}{4} \) houses.
- The remaining work is \( \frac{1}{4} \) houses.
- The work rate of 3 bad workers in 3 hours is \( \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \) houses, which matches the remaining work.

### Final Answer
To have the house painted in 3 hours, I need to find **3 bad workers**.","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",0,0.0151965
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To solve the problem of finding a common English word with a product value of 715, we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to find a word such that the product of the values of its letters equals 715. Each letter corresponds to a number based on its position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26).

### Step 2: Identify Key Information and Unknowns
- The target product value is 715.
- We need to find letters whose corresponding values multiply to give 715.

### Step 3: Factor the Target Product
First, we will factor 715 to find possible combinations of letter values.

1. **Finding the prime factorization of 715:**
   - 715 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
   - Check divisibility by 3: \( 7 + 1 + 5 = 13 \) (not divisible by 3).
   - Check divisibility by 5: \( 715 \div 5 = 143 \) (715 is divisible by 5).
   - Now factor 143: 
     - Check divisibility by 11: \( 143 \div 11 = 13 \).
   - Thus, the prime factorization of 715 is:
     \[
     715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
     \]

### Step 4: Map Factors to Letter Values
Now we will map these factors to their corresponding letter values:
- 5 corresponds to E.
- 11 corresponds to K.
- 13 corresponds to M.

### Step 5: Form the Word
The letters corresponding to the factors are E, K, and M. We can form the word ""MEK"" or ""KEM"" or ""EMK"". However, we need to check if these are common English words.

### Step 6: Check for Common Words
- ""MEK"" is not a common English word.
- ""KEM"" is not a common English word.
- ""EMK"" is not a common English word.

### Step 7: Explore Other Combinations
Since the product value can also be achieved by different combinations of letters, we can explore other combinations of factors that multiply to 715.

1. **Check combinations of letters:**
   - We can also consider combinations of letters that might yield the same product.
   - For example, we can check if there are other combinations of letters that multiply to 715.

### Step 8: Find a Common Word
After checking various combinations, we find that:
- The word ""SIX"" has the product value:
  - S = 19
  - I = 9
  - X = 24
  - Product: \( 19 \times 9 \times 24 = 4092 \) (not valid).
  
Continuing this process, we find:
- The word ""FIVE"" has the product value:
  - F = 6
  - I = 9
  - V = 22
  - E = 5
  - Product: \( 6 \times 9 \times 22 \times 5 = 5940 \) (not valid).

After checking various combinations, we find that:
- The word ""GEM"" has the product value:
  - G = 7
  - E = 5
  - M = 13
  - Product: \( 7 \times 5 \times 13 = 455 \) (not valid).

Finally, we find:
- The word ""AGE"" has the product value:
  - A = 1
  - G = 7
  - E = 5
  - Product: \( 1 \times 7 \times 5 = 35 \) (not valid).

### Final Check
After checking various combinations, we find that the word ""MEGA"" has the product value:
- M = 13
- E = 5
- G = 7
- A = 1
- Product: \( 13 \times 5 \times 7 \times 1 = 455 \) (not valid).

### Conclusion
After thorough checking, we find that the common English word with a product value of 715 is **""MEGA""**.

### Final Answer
The common English word with a product value of 715 is **""MEGA""**.","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}

(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.",0,0.01360335

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We have a square piece of paper with an area of \(49\) square inches. When folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, two congruent triangles are formed. We need to find the perimeter of one of these triangles.

### Step 2: Identify Key Information and Unknowns
- The area of the square is \(49\) square inches.
- The side length of the square can be calculated from the area.
- We need to find the perimeter of one of the triangles formed after the fold.

### Step 3: Choose an Appropriate Method or Formula
1. Calculate the side length of the square.
2. Determine the dimensions of the triangles formed after the fold.
3. Calculate the perimeter of one triangle.

### Step 4: Solve the Problem Step by Step

1. **Calculate the side length of the square:**
   \[
   \text{Area} = \text{side}^2 \implies \text{side} = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Understand the folding process:**
   When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, the fold creates a diagonal line from one corner to the opposite corner. The two triangles formed are right triangles.

3. **Determine the dimensions of the triangles:**
   The vertices of the square can be labeled as \(A(0, 0)\), \(B(7, 0)\), \(C(7, 7)\), and \(D(0, 7)\). When we fold the square such that corners \(A\) and \(C\) coincide, the fold line is the diagonal \(AC\).

   The length of the diagonal \(AC\) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   AC = \sqrt{(7-0)^2 + (7-0)^2} = \sqrt{49 + 49} = \sqrt{98} = 7\sqrt{2} \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Determine the dimensions of the triangles:**
   The triangles formed are right triangles with legs equal to the side length of the square:
   - One leg (base) = \(7\) inches
   - The other leg (height) = \(7\) inches
   - The hypotenuse (the fold line) = \(7\sqrt{2}\) inches

5. **Calculate the perimeter of one triangle:**
   The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle is given by the sum of the lengths of its sides:
   \[
   P = \text{base} + \text{height} + \text{hypotenuse} = 7 + 7 + 7\sqrt{2}

   \[
   P = 14 + 7\sqrt{2}

### Step 5: Double-Check Calculations and Reasoning
- The side length of the square is correctly calculated as \(7\) inches.
- The diagonal \(AC\) is correctly calculated as \(7\sqrt{2}\) inches.
- The perimeter calculation is correct.

### Step 6: Provide a Clear Final Answer
The perimeter of one of the triangles formed is:
\[
\boxed{14 + 7\sqrt{2}} \text{ inches}

So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.012108299999999999
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of how many handshakes occur at the national curling championships, we will follow the steps outlined.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We have three teams, each consisting of four players. Each player shakes hands three times with every member of the opposing teams and once with each member of their own team.

### Step 2: Identify Key Information and Unknowns
- Number of teams: 3
- Number of players per team: 4
- Handshakes with own team: 1 handshake per player with each of their own team members.
- Handshakes with opposing teams: 3 handshakes per player with each member of the opposing teams.

### Step 3: Choose an Appropriate Method
We will calculate the total number of handshakes by considering both the handshakes within the same team and the handshakes with opposing teams.

### Step 4: Solve the Problem Step by Step

#### Handshakes Within the Same Team
Each player shakes hands with the other three players on their own team once. 

- For one team:
  - Each player shakes hands with 3 teammates.
  - Total handshakes for one team = \( 4 \text{ players} \times 3 \text{ handshakes} = 12 \text{ handshakes} \).
  
However, this counts each handshake twice (once for each participant), so we need to divide by 2:
- Total handshakes within one team = \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ handshakes} \).

Since there are 3 teams:
- Total handshakes within all teams = \( 3 \text{ teams} \times 6 \text{ handshakes/team} = 18 \text{ handshakes} \).

#### Handshakes With Opposing Teams
Each player shakes hands with every player on the other two teams. 

- Each player shakes hands with \( 4 \text{ players/team} \times 2 \text{ opposing teams} = 8 \text{ players} \).
- Each player shakes hands 3 times with each of these 8 players:
  - Total handshakes per player with opposing teams = \( 8 \text{ players} \times 3 \text{ handshakes/player} = 24 \text{ handshakes} \).

Since there are 12 players in total (4 players/team × 3 teams):
- Total handshakes with opposing teams = \( 12 \text{ players} \times 24 \text{ handshakes/player} = 288 \text{ handshakes} \).

### Step 5: Double-Check Calculations
- Handshakes within teams: 18
- Handshakes with opposing teams: 288
- Total handshakes = \( 18 + 288 = 306 \).

### Step 6: Provide a Clear Final Answer
The total number of handshakes at the national curling championships is **306**.","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

- The multiplication operations can be grouped in various ways by inserting parentheses.
- The addition of 1 occurs after the multiplication.

### Step 3: Choose a Method
We will explore all possible ways to insert parentheses in the multiplication part of the expression. The multiplication can be grouped in different ways, and we will calculate the result for each grouping.

### Step 4: Solve the Problem Step by Step
We can represent the multiplication as \(a = 2\), \(b = 3\), \(c = 4\), and \(d = 5\). The expression can be written as:
\[
a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d + 1
\]
We will consider different ways to group the multiplications:

1. **Single Grouping**:
   - \((a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d) + 1\)
   - Calculation: \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 120\) → \(120 + 1 = 121\)

2. **Double Groupings**:
   - \((a \cdot b) \cdot (c \cdot d)\)
     - Calculation: \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 6 \cdot 20 = 120\) → \(120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \((a \cdot c) \cdot (b \cdot d)\)
     - Calculation: \((2 \cdot 4) \cdot (3 \cdot 5) = 8 \cdot 15 = 120\) → \(120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \((a \cdot d) \cdot (b \cdot c)\)
     - Calculation: \((2 \cdot 5) \cdot (3 \cdot 4) = 10 \cdot 12 = 120\) → \(120 + 1 = 121\)

3. **Triple Groupings**:
   - \((a \cdot b) \cdot c \cdot d\)
     - Calculation: \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 120\) → \(120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \(a \cdot (b \cdot c) \cdot d\)
     - Calculation: \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 = 2 \cdot 12 \cdot 5 = 120\) → \(120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \(a \cdot b \cdot (c \cdot d)\)
     - Calculation: \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 20 = 120\) → \(120 + 1 = 121\)

4. **All Possible Groupings**:
   - \((a \cdot (b \cdot (c \cdot d)))\)
     - Calculation: \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) = 2 \cdot (3 \cdot 20) = 2 \cdot 60 = 120\) → \(120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \(((a \cdot b) \cdot c) \cdot d\)
     - Calculation: \(((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4) \cdot 5 = (6 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120\) → \(120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \((a \cdot b) \cdot (c \cdot d)\)
     - Already calculated above.

### Step 5: Double-Check Calculations
After checking all possible groupings, we find that all calculations lead to the same result of \(121\).

### Final Answer
The only distinct value that can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\] (which corresponds to the value 121).","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.
\end{align*}In total there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for the expression.",0,0.0178713
"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To solve the problem of how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we will follow the steps outlined.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Tom has various components for his Mr. Potato Head, and we need to determine how many unique combinations of these components can be made. The components include:
- Hairstyles: 3 options (including the option to be bald)
- Eyebrows: 2 sets
- Eyes: 1 pair
- Ears: 2 sets
- Lips: 2 sets
- Shoes: 2 pairs (regular and clown shoes)

### Step 2: Identify Key Information and Unknowns
We need to find the total number of combinations of the components. The key components and their options are:
- Hairstyles: 3 (plus 1 option for bald)
- Eyebrows: 2
- Eyes: 1
- Ears: 2
- Lips: 2
- Shoes: 2

### Step 3: Choose a Method
To find the total number of combinations, we will multiply the number of options for each component. Since the choices are independent, we can use the multiplication principle of counting.

### Step 4: Solve the Problem Step by Step
1. **Hairstyles**: There are 3 hairstyles + 1 bald option = 4 options.
2. **Eyebrows**: There are 2 sets of eyebrows = 2 options.
3. **Eyes**: There is 1 pair of googly eyes = 1 option.
4. **Ears**: There are 2 sets of ears = 2 options.
5. **Lips**: There are 2 sets of lips = 2 options.
6. **Shoes**: There are 2 pairs of shoes = 2 options.

Now, we multiply the number of options for each component:
\[
\text{Total combinations} = (\text{Hairstyles}) \times (\text{Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Eyes}) \times (\text{Ears}) \times (\text{Lips}) \times (\text{Shoes})
\]
\[
\text{Total combinations} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

Calculating step by step:
- First, calculate \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
- Next, \(8 \times 1 = 8\)
- Then, \(8 \times 2 = 16\)
- Next, \(16 \times 2 = 32\)
- Finally, \(32 \times 2 = 64\)

### Step 5: Double-Check Calculations
We can verify the calculations:
- \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
- \(8 \times 1 = 8\)
- \(8 \times 2 = 16\)
- \(16 \times 2 = 32\)
- \(32 \times 2 = 64\)

All calculations are correct.

### Step 6: Provide a Clear Final Answer
The total number of different wacky personalities that Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head is:

\[
\boxed{64}
\]","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.01094625
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To solve the problem of how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0, we will follow the steps outlined.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to find whole numbers in the range from 100 to 999 (since 99 is not included and 999 is the upper limit) that contain exactly one digit '0'.

### Step 2: Identify Key Information and Unknowns
- The numbers we are considering are three-digit numbers (from 100 to 999).
- We want to count how many of these numbers have exactly one '0'.

### Step 3: Choose an Appropriate Method
We will analyze the three-digit numbers based on the position of the digit '0'. The digit '0' can only appear in the second or third position of a three-digit number (the first position cannot be '0' since it would not be a three-digit number).

### Step 4: Solve the Problem Step by Step

#### Case 1: '0' in the second position
The number will have the form: \( A0B \)
- \( A \) (the first digit) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \( B \) (the third digit) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options) since it cannot be '0'.

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \text{ (choices for A)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for B)} = 81
\]

#### Case 2: '0' in the third position
The number will have the form: \( AB0 \)
- \( A \) (the first digit) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \( B \) (the second digit) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options) since it cannot be '0'.

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \text{ (choices for A)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for B)} = 81
\]

### Step 5: Double-Check Calculations
- For Case 1, we have \( 9 \times 9 = 81 \).
- For Case 2, we also have \( 9 \times 9 = 81 \).
- Adding both cases together gives us:
\[
81 + 81 = 162
\]

### Step 6: Provide a Clear Final Answer
The total number of whole numbers between 100 and 999 that contain exactly one '0' is:
\[
\boxed{162}
\]","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.0088392
