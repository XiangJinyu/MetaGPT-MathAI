"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We have a convex pentagon with:
- Two congruent acute angles (let's denote each of these angles as \( x \)).
- Three other angles, each equal to the sum of the two acute angles.

### Step 2: Identify Key Information and Unknowns
- Let the two acute angles be \( x \).
- The measure of each of the other three angles is \( 2x \) (since each is equal to the sum of the two acute angles, \( x + x = 2x \)).
- We need to find the common measure of the large angles, which is \( 2x \).

### Step 3: Choose an Appropriate Method or Formula
The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
\]
where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, \( n = 5 \):
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
\]

### Step 4: Set Up the Equation
The total sum of the angles in the pentagon can be expressed as:
\[
x + x + 2x + 2x + 2x = 540^\circ
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 6x = 540^\circ
\]
\[
8x = 540^\circ
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
Now, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
\]

### Step 6: Find the Measure of the Large Angles
The measure of each of the large angles is:
\[
2x = 2 \times 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ
\]

### Step 7: Double-Check Calculations
- The two acute angles are \( 67.5^\circ \) each.
- The three large angles are \( 135^\circ \) each.
- The total sum of the angles is:
\[
2 \times 67.5^\circ + 3 \times 135^\circ = 135^\circ + 405^\circ = 540^\circ
\]
This confirms our calculations are correct.

### Final Answer
The common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is \( \boxed{135} \) degrees.","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.010059749999999998

[/asy]","To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \( n \) in the given magic square. A magic square is defined such that the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are equal.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We have a 3x3 magic square with the following entries:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 2: Identify Key Information and Unknowns
The unknown is \( n \). We need to find the common sum of the rows, columns, and diagonals.

### Step 3: Choose a Method
We will calculate the sum of the first row and set it equal to the sum of the second row and the third row, and then we will use the sums of the columns and diagonals to find \( n \).

### Step 4: Solve the Problem Step by Step

1. **Calculate the sum of the first row:**
   \[
   (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
   \]

2. **Calculate the sum of the second row:**
   \[
   3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the sum of the third row:**
   \[
   (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

4. **Set the sums of the rows equal to each other:**
   Since the first and third rows both sum to \( 2n + 1 \), we can set the second row equal to this:
   \[
   3n - 6 = 2n + 1
   \]

5. **Solve for \( n \):**
   \[
   3n - 2n = 1 + 6
   \]
   \[
   n = 7
   \]

### Step 5: Double-Check Calculations
Now we will verify that \( n = 7 \) satisfies the magic square condition.

1. **Substituting \( n = 7 \) into the square:**
   \[
   \begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
   \hline
   4 & 9 & 2 \\
   \hline
   3 & 5 & 7 \\
   \hline
   8 & 1 & 6 \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   \]

2. **Check the sums:**
   - First row: \( 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \)
   - Second row: \( 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \)
   - Third row: \( 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \)
   - First column: \( 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \)
   - Second column: \( 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \)
   - Third column: \( 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \)
   - Diagonal (top-left to bottom-right): \( 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)
   - Diagonal (top-right to bottom-left): \( 2 + 5 + 8 = 15 \)

All sums equal 15, confirming that our solution is correct.

### Final Answer
The value of \( n \) is \( \boxed{7} \).","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to determine how many bad workers are required to help 3 good workers paint a house in 3 hours. 

### Step 2: Identify Key Information and Unknowns
- Each good worker can paint the house in 12 hours.
- Each bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours.
- We have 3 good workers.
- We need the house painted in 3 hours.

### Step 3: Choose an Appropriate Method or Formula
We will calculate the work done by the good workers and the bad workers in terms of ""houses per hour"" and then set up an equation to find the number of bad workers needed.

### Step 4: Solve the Problem Step by Step

1. **Calculate the work rate of a good worker:**
   - A good worker can paint the house in 12 hours, so their work rate is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of one good worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate the work rate of 3 good workers:**
   - If there are 3 good workers, their combined work rate is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of 3 good workers} = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

3. **Calculate the work rate of a bad worker:**
   - A bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours, so their work rate is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of one bad worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

4. **Let \( x \) be the number of bad workers. Calculate the combined work rate of the bad workers:**
   - The combined work rate of \( x \) bad workers is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of } x \text{ bad workers} = x \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{x}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

5. **Set up the equation for total work rate:**
   - We need the total work rate of the good and bad workers to equal the rate needed to paint 1 house in 3 hours:
     \[
     \text{Total work rate} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{x}{36} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{3 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

6. **Solve the equation:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} + \frac{x}{36} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   - To eliminate the fractions, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4, 36, and 3 is 36. Multiply the entire equation by 36:
   \[
   36 \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) + 36 \left(\frac{x}{36}\right) = 36 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)
   \]
   - This simplifies to:
   \[
   9 + x = 12
   \]
   - Now, solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 12 - 9 = 3
   \]

### Step 5: Double-Check Calculations
- The total work rate of 3 good workers is \( \frac{1}{4} \) houses per hour.
- The total work rate of 3 bad workers is \( \frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{12} \) houses per hour.
- Combined work rate:
  \[
  \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ houses per hour}
  \]
- This matches the requirement to paint 1 house in 3 hours.

### Final Answer
You need to find **3 bad workers** to ensure the house is painted in 3 hours.","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",0,0.015175949999999999
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To solve the problem of finding a common English word with a product value of 715, we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to find a word such that the product of the values of its letters equals 715. Each letter corresponds to a number based on its position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26).

### Step 2: Identify Key Information and Unknowns
- The target product value is 715.
- We need to find letters whose corresponding values multiply to give 715.

### Step 3: Factor the Target Product
First, we will factor 715 to find possible combinations of letter values.

1. **Factor 715**:
   - Start by dividing by the smallest prime number:
     - \( 715 \div 5 = 143 \) (since 715 ends in 5, it is divisible by 5)
   - Now factor 143:
     - \( 143 \div 11 = 13 \) (11 is a prime number and 13 is also prime)
   - Thus, the complete factorization of 715 is:
     \[
     715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
     \]

### Step 4: Map Factors to Letters
Now we will map these factors to their corresponding letters:
- 5 corresponds to E
- 11 corresponds to K
- 13 corresponds to M

### Step 5: Form the Word
The letters we have are E, K, and M. We can form the word ""MEK"" or ""KEM"", but these are not common English words. 

Next, we can check if there are other combinations of letters that could yield the same product. 

### Step 6: Check Other Combinations
We can also consider combinations of letters that multiply to 715. 

1. **Check for other combinations**:
   - The factors of 715 are \( 5, 11, 13 \).
   - We can also consider combinations of smaller letters:
     - \( 1 \times 7 \times 5 \times 11 = 385 \) (not useful)
     - \( 1 \times 3 \times 5 \times 11 = 165 \) (not useful)
     - \( 1 \times 5 \times 7 \times 11 = 385 \) (not useful)
     - \( 1 \times 5 \times 13 = 65 \) (not useful)
     - \( 1 \times 11 \times 13 = 143 \) (not useful)

### Step 7: Verify the Product
We can also check if there are any other combinations of letters that yield 715:
- The letters E (5), K (11), and M (13) yield the product:
  \[
  5 \times 11 \times 13 = 715
  \]

### Final Answer
After checking various combinations and confirming the product, we find that the common English word that has a product value of 715 is **""MEK""** or **""KEM""**. However, these are not common words. 

Upon further consideration, the word **""ME""** (M=13, E=5) does not yield 715, but the combination of letters E, K, and M does yield 715. 

Thus, the answer is:
**The common English word with a product value of 715 is ""MEK"" or ""KEM"", but these are not common words. The letters E, K, and M yield the product value of 715.**","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}
(5)\cdot (11) \cdot (13) &= 5\cdot 11\cdot 13 \\
(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.",0,0.013426049999999998
Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"To estimate \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred, we can follow these steps:

### Step 4: Solve the Problem Step by Step
1. **Round the number**: 
   \[
   14.7923412 \approx 15
   \]

2. **Square the rounded number**:
   \[
   15^2 = 225

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We have a square piece of paper with an area of \(49\) square inches. When folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, two congruent triangles are formed. We need to find the perimeter of one of these triangles.

### Step 2: Identify Key Information and Unknowns
- The area of the square is \(49\) square inches.
- The side length of the square can be calculated from the area.
- We need to find the perimeter of one of the triangles formed after the fold.

### Step 3: Calculate the Side Length of the Square
The area \(A\) of a square is given by the formula:
\[
A = s^2
\]
where \(s\) is the side length. Given that \(A = 49\):
\[
s^2 = 49
\]
Taking the square root of both sides:
\[
s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the Folding and Form the Triangles
When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, the fold creates a diagonal line from one corner to the opposite corner. This diagonal divides the square into two congruent right triangles.

The vertices of the square can be labeled as \(A(0, 0)\), \(B(7, 0)\), \(C(7, 7)\), and \(D(0, 7)\). When we fold the square, we can fold corner \(A\) to corner \(C\).

### Step 5: Determine the Dimensions of the Triangles
The right triangles formed will have:
- One leg along the side of the square (length \(s = 7\) inches).
- The other leg will also be \(7\) inches (the height from the base to the top vertex).

The hypotenuse of the triangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
\text{Hypotenuse} = \sqrt{(7)^2 + (7)^2} = \sqrt{49 + 49} = \sqrt{98} = 7\sqrt{2}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the Perimeter of One Triangle
The perimeter \(P\) of one of the triangles is the sum of the lengths of its three sides:
\[
P = \text{leg}_1 + \text{leg}_2 + \text{hypotenuse}
\]
Substituting the values we found:
\[
P = 7 + 7 + 7\sqrt{2} = 14 + 7\sqrt{2}
\]

### Step 7: Final Answer
Thus, the perimeter of one of the triangles is:
\[
\boxed{14 + 7\sqrt{2}} \text{ inches}
\]","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.013047299999999998
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of how many handshakes occur at the national curling championships, we will follow the steps outlined.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We have three teams, each consisting of four players. Each player shakes hands three times with every member of the opposing teams and once with each member of their own team.

### Step 2: Identify Key Information and Unknowns
- Number of teams: 3
- Number of players per team: 4
- Handshakes with own team: 1 handshake per player with each of their own team members.
- Handshakes with opposing teams: 3 handshakes per player with each member of the opposing teams.

### Step 3: Choose an Appropriate Method
We will calculate the total number of handshakes by considering both the handshakes within the same team and the handshakes with opposing teams.

### Step 4: Solve the Problem Step by Step

#### Handshakes Within the Same Team
Each player shakes hands with the other three players on their own team once. 

- For one team:
  - Each player shakes hands with 3 teammates.
  - Total handshakes for one team = \( 4 \text{ players} \times 3 \text{ handshakes} = 12 \text{ handshakes} \).
  
However, this counts each handshake twice (once for each participant), so we need to divide by 2:
- Total handshakes within one team = \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ handshakes} \).

Since there are 3 teams:
- Total handshakes within all teams = \( 3 \text{ teams} \times 6 \text{ handshakes/team} = 18 \text{ handshakes} \).

#### Handshakes With Opposing Teams
Each player shakes hands with every player on the other two teams. 

- Each player shakes hands with \( 4 \text{ players/team} \times 2 \text{ opposing teams} = 8 \text{ players} \).
- Each player shakes hands 3 times with each of these 8 players:
  - Total handshakes per player with opposing teams = \( 8 \text{ players} \times 3 \text{ handshakes/player} = 24 \text{ handshakes} \).

Since there are 12 players in total (4 players/team × 3 teams):
- Total handshakes with opposing teams = \( 12 \text{ players} \times 24 \text{ handshakes/player} = 288 \text{ handshakes} \).

### Step 5: Double-Check Calculations
- Handshakes within teams: 18
- Handshakes with opposing teams: 288
- Total handshakes = \( 18 + 288 = 306 \).

### Step 6: Provide a Clear Final Answer
The total number of handshakes at the national curling championships is **306**.","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

There are 12 players in total, which offers $12\times27=324$ handshakes, but since a handshake takes place between two people, we've counted every handshake twice.

The expression consists of four multiplication operations and one addition operation:
\[
2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1
\]
The multiplication operations can be grouped in different ways by inserting parentheses.

### Step 2: Identify Key Information
- The multiplication operations are between the numbers \(2\), \(3\), \(4\), and \(5\).
- The addition operation is with \(1\).
- We need to find all possible distinct values by changing the grouping of the multiplication.

We will systematically explore all possible ways to insert parentheses in the multiplication part of the expression. The addition of \(1\) will be done after calculating the product.

### Step 4: Solve the Problem Step by Step
We can group the multiplications in different ways. The possible groupings can be represented as follows:

1. **Single Grouping**:
   - \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5)\)
   - Value: \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 120\)

### Step 5: Double-Check Calculations
After checking all possible groupings, we find that all combinations yield the same product of \(120\) before adding \(1\).

### Final Answer
The only distinct value obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses is:
\[
\boxed{121}
\] 

Thus, there is only **one distinct value** that can be obtained.","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.
\end{align*}In total there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for the expression.",0,0.017899649999999996
"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To solve the problem of how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we will follow the steps outlined.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Tom has various components for his Mr. Potato Head, and we need to determine how many unique combinations of these components can be made. The components include:
- Hairstyles: 3 options (including the option to be bald)
- Eyebrows: 2 sets
- Eyes: 1 pair
- Ears: 2 sets
- Lips: 2 sets
- Shoes: 2 pairs (regular and clown shoes)

### Step 2: Identify Key Information and Unknowns
We need to find the total number of combinations of the components. The key components and their options are:
- Hairstyles: 3 (plus 1 option for being bald, making it 4 total)
- Eyebrows: 2
- Eyes: 1
- Ears: 2
- Lips: 2
- Shoes: 2

### Step 3: Choose a Method
To find the total number of combinations, we will multiply the number of options for each component together. This is because each choice is independent of the others.

### Step 4: Solve the Problem Step by Step
1. **Count the options for each component:**
   - Hairstyles: 4 (3 hairstyles + 1 bald option)
   - Eyebrows: 2
   - Eyes: 1
   - Ears: 2
   - Lips: 2
   - Shoes: 2

2. **Multiply the number of options:**
   \[
   \text{Total combinations} = (\text{Hairstyles}) \times (\text{Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Eyes}) \times (\text{Ears}) \times (\text{Lips}) \times (\text{Shoes})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total combinations} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
   \]

3. **Calculate step by step:**
   - First, calculate \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
   - Next, \(8 \times 1 = 8\)
   - Then, \(8 \times 2 = 16\)
   - Next, \(16 \times 2 = 32\)
   - Finally, \(32 \times 2 = 64\)

### Step 5: Double-Check Calculations
Let's verify the calculations:
- \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
- \(8 \times 1 = 8\)
- \(8 \times 2 = 16\)
- \(16 \times 2 = 32\)
- \(32 \times 2 = 64\)

All calculations are correct.

### Step 6: Provide a Clear Final Answer
The total number of different wacky personalities that Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head is:

\[
\boxed{64}
\]","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.010415549999999997
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To solve the problem of how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0, we will follow the steps outlined.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to find whole numbers in the range from 100 to 999 (since 99 is not included and 999 is the upper limit) that contain exactly one digit '0'.

### Step 2: Identify Key Information and Unknowns
- The numbers we are considering are three-digit numbers (from 100 to 999).
- We want to count how many of these numbers have exactly one '0'.

### Step 3: Choose an Appropriate Method
We will analyze the three-digit numbers based on the position of the '0'. The '0' can either be in the tens place or the units place, as having '0' in the hundreds place would not yield a three-digit number.

### Step 4: Solve the Problem Step by Step

#### Case 1: '0' in the Tens Place
The number can be represented as \( A0B \), where:
- \( A \) is the hundreds digit (can be 1 to 9, so 9 options).
- \( B \) is the units digit (can be 1 to 9, so 9 options).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \text{ (choices for } A\text{)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for } B\text{)} = 81
\]

#### Case 2: '0' in the Units Place
The number can be represented as \( AB0 \), where:
- \( A \) is the hundreds digit (can be 1 to 9, so 9 options).
- \( B \) is the tens digit (can be 1 to 9, so 9 options).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \text{ (choices for } A\text{)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for } B\text{)} = 81
\]

### Step 5: Combine the Results
Now, we add the results from both cases:
\[
81 \text{ (from Case 1)} + 81 \text{ (from Case 2)} = 162
\]

### Step 6: Double-Check Calculations
- For Case 1, we confirmed that there are 9 choices for \( A \) and 9 choices for \( B \), leading to 81 combinations.
- For Case 2, we also confirmed that there are 9 choices for \( A \) and 9 choices for \( B \), leading to another 81 combinations.
- Adding both cases gives us 162.

### Final Answer
The total number of whole numbers between 100 and 999 that contain exactly one '0' is:
\[
\boxed{162}
\]","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.008344799999999998
