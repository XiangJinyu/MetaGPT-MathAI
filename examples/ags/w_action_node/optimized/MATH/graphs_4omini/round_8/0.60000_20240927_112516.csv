"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","The verified solution is complete and accurate. All aspects of the problem have been addressed, and the calculations are correct. The final answer is formatted properly using LaTeX notation.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{135}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.0188886

Here’s a brief recap of the solution:

1. The elements of the magic square were correctly identified.
2. The sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals were calculated accurately.
3. The equations were set up and solved correctly, leading to the conclusion that \( n = 7 \).

No further simplifications or improvements are necessary. 

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6.

Here’s a concise restatement of the final answer:

\[
\boxed{\text{No common English word found with a product value of 715.}}
\]","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}
(5)\cdot (11) \cdot (13) &= 5\cdot 11\cdot 13 \\
(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","The final answer provided in the verified solution is correct, but it can be simplified for clarity. The term \(\frac{7}{2}\) can be expressed as \(3.5\), which is already used in the solution. 

However, to maintain consistency and clarity, we can express the final answer in a more straightforward form. The perimeter of one triangle can be rewritten as:

\[
P = 7 + 3.5\sqrt{2}
\]

This is equivalent to:

\[
P = 7 + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

Both forms are valid, but the latter is more consistent with the original expression. 

Thus, the final answer, formatted correctly in LaTeX notation, is:

\[
\boxed{7 + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}}
\] 

This maintains the integrity of the solution while ensuring clarity and simplicity.","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.0167847
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

"The expression $2\cdot 3 \cdot 4\cdot 5+1$ is equal to 121, since multiplication is carried out before addition. However, we can obtain values other than 121 for this expression if we are allowed to change it by inserting parentheses. For example, we can obtain 144 by writing \[
(2\cdot (3\cdot 4)) \cdot (5+1) = 144.
\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).","The verified solution is complete and addresses all aspects of the problem. Here’s a concise restatement of the final answer, ensuring all formatting and simplifications are correct:

The expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) can yield only one distinct value when parentheses are inserted, as all groupings lead to the same product of 120, resulting in 121 when 1 is added.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
