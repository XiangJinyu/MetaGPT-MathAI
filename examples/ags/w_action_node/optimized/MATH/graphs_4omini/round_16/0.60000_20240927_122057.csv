"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

1. **Review the problem statement**: We have a convex pentagon with two congruent acute angles, and the other three angles are each equal to the sum of the two acute angles.

2. **Check for logical errors**: 
   - Let the measure of each acute angle be \( x \). Therefore, the two acute angles together measure \( 2x \).
   - The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is \( 540^\circ \).
   - The three larger angles, each equal to \( 2x \), would then total \( 3(2x) = 6x \).
   - The equation for the sum of the angles becomes:
     \[
     2x + 6x = 540^\circ
     \]
     Simplifying gives:
     \[
     8x = 540^\circ \implies x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
     \]
   - The measure of each of the larger angles is \( 2x = 2(67.5^\circ) = 135^\circ \).

3. **Verify that the solution addresses all parts**: The solution correctly identifies the measures of the angles and confirms that the larger angles are indeed \( 135^\circ \).

4. **Check units and format**: The answer is in degrees, which is appropriate for angle measures.

5. **Final answer**: No errors were found in the analysis or calculations. The final answer remains:

\[
\boxed{135}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.020266500000000003

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( n \) in a magic square where the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals are equal.

2. **Check for Errors**: 
   - The entries of the magic square are:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
     3 & 2n-9 & n \\
     n+1 & 1 & n-1

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","Let's analyze the problem and the simplified solution step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have good workers who can paint the house in 12 hours and bad workers who can do it in 36 hours. We need the house painted in 3 hours with 3 good workers and some unknown number of bad workers.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculations**:
   - The rate of work for a good worker is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of the house per hour.
   - The rate of work for a bad worker is \( \frac{1}{36} \) of the house per hour.
   - With 3 good workers, their combined rate is:
     \[
     3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the house per hour.}
     \]
   - Let \( b \) be the number of bad workers. Their combined rate is:
     \[
     b \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{b}{36} \text{ of the house per hour.}
     \]
   - The total rate of work with both good and bad workers is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} + \frac{b}{36}.
     \]
   - We need this total rate to complete the house in 3 hours, which means it must equal \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the house per hour:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} + \frac{b}{36} = \frac{1}{3}.
     \]

3. **Solving the Equation**:
   - To solve for \( b \), we first find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 4, 36, and 3 is 36.
   - Rewriting the equation:
     \[
     \frac{9}{36} + \frac{b}{36} = \frac{12}{36}.
     \]
   - Combining the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{9 + b}{36} = \frac{12}{36}.
     \]
   - Cross-multiplying gives:
     \[
     9 + b = 12.
     \]
   - Solving for \( b \):
     \[
     b = 12 - 9 = 3.
     \]

4. **Final Verification**: The solution correctly calculates the number of bad workers needed. The answer is in the correct format and units.

5. **Final Answer**: The number of bad workers needed is:
\[
\boxed{3}

What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","1. The problem requires finding a common English word whose letters' product values equal 715, using the letter values A = 1, B = 2, ..., Z = 26.

2. The prime factorization of 715 is \(5 \times 11 \times 13\). Each of these factors corresponds to the letter values:
   - 5 = E
   - 11 = K
   - 13 = M

3. The letters E, K, and M can be combined to form the word ""MEK"" or ""KEM,"" but these are not common English words. 

4. Checking for other combinations or longer words that could yield a product of 715, we find that no common English words can be formed from the letters corresponding to the factors of 715.

5. Since no errors were found in the analysis, and the conclusion remains that no common English word with a product value of 715 exists, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{No common English word with a product value of 715 found.}}
\]","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}
(5)\cdot (11) \cdot (13) &= 5\cdot 11\cdot 13 \\
(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","Let's perform the error analysis and correction on the simplified solution.

1. **Review the problem statement**: A square piece of paper with an area of \(49\) square inches is folded, creating two congruent triangles upon unfolding.

2. **Check for logical errors and calculations**:
   - The area of the square is \(49\) square inches, which means the side length \(s\) of the square is:
     \[
     s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, the fold creates a diagonal line that divides the square into two congruent right triangles.

3. **Verify the solution**:
   - Each triangle has legs of length \(7\) inches (the sides of the square).
   - The hypotenuse \(h\) of each triangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     h = \sqrt{7^2 + 7^2} = \sqrt{49 + 49} = \sqrt{98} = 7\sqrt{2}
     \]
   - The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle is given by the sum of the lengths of its sides:
     \[
     P = 7 + 7 + 7\sqrt{2} = 14 + 7\sqrt{2}

4. **Check units and format**: The perimeter is expressed in inches, which is correct.

5. **Final answer**: The simplified solution provided was incorrect. The correct perimeter of one of the triangles is:
   \[
   \boxed{14 + 7\sqrt{2}}

"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: There are three teams of four players each. Each player shakes hands three times with every member of the opposing teams and once with each member of their own team.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculation Mistakes**:
   - Each team has 4 players, so there are a total of \(3 \times 4 = 12\) players.
   - Each player shakes hands with 4 teammates once, resulting in \(4 - 1 = 3\) handshakes with their own team.
   - Each player shakes hands with \(4 \times 2 = 8\) players from the other two teams (3 handshakes with each of the 4 players from each of the 2 opposing teams).

3. **Calculating Total Handshakes**:
   - Handshakes within the same team: Each player shakes hands with 3 teammates, so for one team, the total handshakes are:
     \[
     \text{Handshakes within one team} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2} = 6
     \]
     Since there are 3 teams:
     \[
     \text{Total handshakes within teams} = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]
   - Handshakes with opposing teams: Each player shakes hands with 8 players from the opposing teams, and since there are 12 players:
     \[
     \text{Total handshakes with opposing teams} = 12 \times 8 = 96
     \]

4. **Total Handshakes**:
   - Adding both contributions:
     \[
     \text{Total handshakes} = 18 + 96 = 114
     \]

5. **Final Answer**: The original simplified solution of 306 is incorrect. The corrected total number of handshakes is:
\[
\boxed{114}
\]","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

There are 12 players in total, which offers $12\times27=324$ handshakes, but since a handshake takes place between two people, we've counted every handshake twice.

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: The expression given is \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\). We need to determine how many distinct values can be obtained by inserting parentheses into this expression.

2. **Check for Errors**: The original expression evaluates to \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\). The solution states that only one value can be obtained, which is incorrect. By inserting parentheses, we can change the order of operations and potentially obtain different results.

3. **Verification of All Possible Parentheses**:
   - \( (2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 6 \cdot 20 + 1 = 121 \)
   - \( (2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 + 1 = (2 \cdot 12) \cdot 5 + 1 = 24 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121 \)
   - \( 2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) + 1 = 2 \cdot (3 \cdot 20) + 1 = 2 \cdot 60 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121 \)
   - \( (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 24 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121 \)
   - \( 2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 2 \cdot 60 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121 \)
   - Other combinations such as \( (2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 \) and variations do not yield new results.

4. **Conclusion**: After checking all possible placements of parentheses, it is clear that all variations lead to the same result of 121. Therefore, the number of distinct values obtainable from the expression is indeed 1.

   - **Hairstyles**: 3 options (including bald)
   - **Eyebrows**: 2 options
   - **Eyes**: 1 option
   - **Ears**: 2 options
   - **Lips**: 2 options
   - **Shoes**: 2 options (regular and clown)

3. **Logical Structure**: 
   - For hairstyles, since Mr. Potato Head can be bald, we have 3 hairstyles + 1 bald option = 4 options.
   - The other components are straightforward as they have fixed options.

4. **Calculation**:
   - Total combinations = (number of hairstyles) × (number of eyebrows) × (number of eyes) × (number of ears) × (number of lips) × (number of shoes)

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We need to find whole numbers between 100 and 999 (inclusive) that contain exactly one digit '0'.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculation Mistakes**: 
   - The range specified is from 100 to 999, not 99 to 999. This means we should only consider three-digit numbers.
   - A three-digit number can have a '0' in either the tens or the units place, but not in the hundreds place (as it would then not be a three-digit number).

3. **Verification of Solution**:
