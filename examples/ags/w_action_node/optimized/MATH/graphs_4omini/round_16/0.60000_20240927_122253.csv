"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

1. **Review the problem statement**: We have a convex pentagon with two congruent acute angles, and the other three angles are each equal to the sum of the two acute angles.

2. **Check for logical errors**: 
   - Let the measure of each acute angle be \( x \). Therefore, the two acute angles together measure \( 2x \).
   - The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is \( 540^\circ \).
   - The three larger angles, each equal to \( 2x \), would then sum to \( 3(2x) = 6x \).
   - The equation for the sum of the angles becomes:
     \[
     2x + 6x = 540^\circ
     \]
     Simplifying gives:
     \[
     8x = 540^\circ \implies x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
     \]
   - The measure of each of the larger angles is \( 2x = 2(67.5^\circ) = 135^\circ \).

3. **Verify that the solution addresses all parts**: The solution correctly identifies the measures of the angles and confirms that the larger angles are indeed \( 135^\circ \).

4. **Check units and format**: The answer is in degrees, which is appropriate for angle measures.

5. **Final verification**: No errors were found in the calculations or logic.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.025857149999999995

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( n \) in a magic square where the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals are equal.

2. **Check for Errors**: 
   - The entries of the magic square are:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
     3 & 2n-9 & n \\
     n+1 & 1 & n-1

   - The sum of the first row is:
     \[
     (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 2n + 1
     \]
   - The sum of the second row is:
     \[
     3 + (2n-9) + n = 3n - 6
     \]
   - The sum of the third row is:
     \[
     (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = 2n + 1
     \]
   - Setting the sums of the first and second rows equal gives:
     \[
     2n + 1 = 3n - 6

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","Let's analyze the problem and the simplified solution step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have good workers who can paint the house in 12 hours and bad workers who can do it in 36 hours. We need the house painted in 3 hours with 3 good workers and some unknown number of bad workers.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculations**:
   - The rate of work for a good worker is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of the house per hour.
   - The rate of work for a bad worker is \( \frac{1}{36} \) of the house per hour.
   - With 3 good workers, their combined rate is:
     \[
     3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the house per hour.}
     \]
   - Let \( b \) be the number of bad workers. Their combined rate is:
     \[
     b \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{b}{36} \text{ of the house per hour.}
     \]
   - The total rate of work with both good and bad workers is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} + \frac{b}{36}.
     \]
   - We need this total rate to complete the house in 3 hours, which means it must equal \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the house per hour:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} + \frac{b}{36} = \frac{1}{3}.
     \]

3. **Solving the Equation**:
   - To solve for \( b \), we first find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 4, 36, and 3 is 36.
   - Rewriting the equation:
     \[
     \frac{9}{36} + \frac{b}{36} = \frac{12}{36}.
     \]
   - Combining the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{9 + b}{36} = \frac{12}{36}.
     \]
   - Cross-multiplying gives:
     \[
     9 + b = 12.
     \]
   - Solving for \( b \):
     \[
     b = 12 - 9 = 3.
     \]

4. **Final Verification**: The solution correctly calculates the number of bad workers needed to meet the requirement of painting the house in 3 hours.

5. **Final Answer**: The simplified solution is correct, and the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.

Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.019956299999999996
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","Let's analyze the problem and the simplified solution step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We need to find a common English word whose product value equals 715, where the product value is calculated by multiplying the numerical values assigned to each letter (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26).

2. **Logical Errors and Calculation Mistakes**: The product value of 715 can be factored to find potential letter combinations. The prime factorization of 715 is:
   \[
   715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
   \]
   The corresponding letters for these values are:
   - 5 = E
   - 11 = K
   - 13 = M

   Therefore, the word ""EKM"" has a product value of \(5 \times 11 \times 13 = 715\). However, ""EKM"" is not a common English word.

3. **Addressing All Parts of the Question**: We need to check if there are any other combinations of letters that could yield a product value of 715. The factors of 715 suggest that we should also consider combinations of smaller letters. 

   After checking various combinations, it appears that no common English words can be formed from the factors of 715 that would yield a product value of 715.

4. **Units and Format**: The answer is requested in the format of a common English word, which we have determined does not exist.

5. **Final Conclusion**: Since no common English word can be formed that has a product value of 715, the simplified solution remains correct.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{None}}
\]","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}
(5)\cdot (11) \cdot (13) &= 5\cdot 11\cdot 13 \\
(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.",0,0.024052499999999994

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have a square piece of paper with an area of \(49\) square inches. The side length of the square is \(\sqrt{49} = 7\) inches. When folded, two opposite corners coincide, forming two congruent triangles.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculations**: 
   - The triangles formed by folding the square will have vertices at the corners of the square and the midpoint of the side opposite the folded corner.
   - The base of each triangle is the side of the square, which is \(7\) inches.
   - The height of each triangle is half the side length of the square, which is \(\frac{7}{2} = 3.5\) inches.

3. **Area of the Triangle**: The area of one triangle can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 7 \times 3.5 = \frac{49}{4} \text{ square inches}.
   \]
   This confirms the triangles are congruent and correctly formed.

4. **Perimeter Calculation**: 
   - The lengths of the sides of the triangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. The two legs of the triangle are \(3.5\) inches (height) and \(3.5\) inches (half the base).
   - The hypotenuse (the folded edge) can be calculated as:
   \[
   c = \sqrt{(3.5)^2 + (3.5)^2} = \sqrt{12.25 + 12.25} = \sqrt{24.5} = \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}.
   \]
   - Therefore, the perimeter \(P\) of one triangle is:
   \[
   P = 7 + 3.5 + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2} = 10.5 + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}.
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: The perimeter of one of the triangles is:
\[
P = 10.5 + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{21}{2} + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{21 + 7\sqrt{2}}{2}.
\]

Thus, the corrected final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{21 + 7\sqrt{2}}{2}}.
\]","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.021407099999999995
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: There are three teams of four players each. Each player shakes hands three times with every member of the opposing teams and once with each member of their own team.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculation Mistakes**:
   - Each team has 4 players, so there are \(3 \times 4 = 12\) players in total.
   - Each player shakes hands with 3 members of each of the 2 opposing teams. Therefore, each player shakes hands with \(3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24\) players from opposing teams.
   - Each player also shakes hands once with each of their own 3 teammates, resulting in \(3\) additional handshakes.
   - Thus, the total handshakes per player is \(24 + 3 = 27\).

3. **Total Handshakes Calculation**:
   - Since there are 12 players, the total number of handshakes is \(12 \times 27 = 324\).
   - However, since each handshake is counted twice (once for each participant), we need to divide by 2: 
   \[
   \text{Total handshakes} = \frac{12 \times 27}{2} = 162.
   \]

4. **Verification of Units and Format**: The answer is a count of handshakes, which is dimensionless and correctly formatted.

5. **Final Answer**: No errors were found in the calculations or logic. The final answer remains:

\(\boxed{162}\)","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: The problem asks how many distinct values can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses.

2. **Check for Errors**: The expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) evaluates to \(121\) without parentheses. However, the problem allows for the insertion of parentheses, which can change the order of operations and potentially yield different results.

3. **Verification of Solutions**: We need to consider all possible ways to insert parentheses in the expression. The possible groupings are:
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1\)

   - \((2 \cdot 3) + (4 \cdot 5)\)
   - \((2 + 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5\)
   - etc.

   Each grouping can yield different results. For example:

   - \((2 + 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 5 \cdot 20 = 100\)
   - \((2 + 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 = (2 + 12) \cdot 5 = 14 \cdot 5 = 70\)

4. **Distinct Values**: After evaluating various combinations, we find that multiple distinct values can be obtained. The original conclusion of \(1\) distinct value is incorrect.

5. **Final Answer**: The total number of distinct values that can be obtained from the expression by inserting parentheses is greater than \(1\). 

Thus, the corrected solution is:
