"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

1. **Review the problem statement**: We have a convex pentagon with two congruent acute angles, and the other three angles are equal to the sum of the two acute angles.

2. **Check for logical errors**: 
   - Let the measure of each acute angle be \( x \). Thus, the two acute angles contribute \( 2x \) to the total angle sum.
   - The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula \( (n-2) \times 180 \) where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, \( n = 5 \), so the total sum is \( 3 \times 180 = 540 \) degrees.
   - The three larger angles, each equal to the sum of the two acute angles, would be \( 3(2x) = 6x \).

3. **Set up the equation**:
   \[
   2x + 6x = 540
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   8x = 540 \implies x = \frac{540}{8} = 67.5
   \]

4. **Calculate the larger angles**: Each of the larger angles is:
   \[
   2x = 2(67.5) = 135 \text{ degrees}
   \]

5. **Verify the solution**: 
   - The two acute angles are \( 67.5 \) degrees each.
   - The three larger angles are \( 135 \) degrees each.
   - The total is \( 2(67.5) + 3(135) = 135 + 405 = 540 \) degrees, which is correct.

6. **Final answer**: The solution correctly identifies the measure of the larger angles.

Since no errors were found, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.021200400000000005

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: We need to find the value of \( n \) in a magic square where the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals are equal.

2. **Check for Errors**: 
   - The entries of the magic square are:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
     3 & 2n-9 & n \\
     n+1 & 1 & n-1

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","Let's analyze the problem and the simplified solution step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have good workers who can paint the house in 12 hours and bad workers who can do it in 36 hours. We need the house painted in 3 hours, and we have 3 good workers. We need to find out how many bad workers are required.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculations**:
   - The rate of work for a good worker is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of the house per hour.
   - The rate of work for a bad worker is \( \frac{1}{36} \) of the house per hour.
   - With 3 good workers, their combined rate is:
     \[
     3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the house per hour.}
     \]
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bad workers. Their combined rate is:
     \[
     x \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{x}{36} \text{ of the house per hour.}
     \]
   - The total rate of work from both good and bad workers must equal the rate needed to complete the house in 3 hours, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the house per hour:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} + \frac{x}{36} = \frac{1}{3}.
     \]

3. **Solving the Equation**:
   - To solve for \( x \), we first find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 4, 36, and 3 is 36.
   - Rewriting the equation:
     \[
     \frac{9}{36} + \frac{x}{36} = \frac{12}{36}.
     \]
   - Combining the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{9 + x}{36} = \frac{12}{36}.
     \]
   - Cross-multiplying gives:
     \[
     9 + x = 12.
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 12 - 9 = 3.
     \]

4. **Final Verification**: The solution correctly calculates the number of bad workers needed. The answer is in the correct format and units.

5. **Final Answer**: The number of bad workers required is:

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: The problem asks for a common English word with a product value of 715, calculated using the values assigned to each letter (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26).

2. **Check for Logical Errors**: The product value of a word is determined by multiplying the values of its letters. We need to verify if the suggested words (""kame"", ""make"", ""meak"") indeed have a product value of 715.

3. **Calculate the Product Values**:
   - For ""kame"":
     - k = 11, a = 1, m = 13, e = 5
     - Product = \(11 \times 1 \times 13 \times 5 = 715\)
   - For ""make"":

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have a square piece of paper with an area of \(49\) square inches. The side length of the square is \(\sqrt{49} = 7\) inches. When folded, two opposite corners coincide, forming two congruent triangles.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculations**: 
   - When the square is folded, the diagonal of the square becomes the base of the triangles formed. The length of the diagonal \(d\) of the square can be calculated using the formula \(d = s\sqrt{2}\), where \(s\) is the side length. Thus, \(d = 7\sqrt{2}\).
   - The height of each triangle is half the side length of the square, which is \(\frac{7}{2}\).

3. **Area of the Triangle**: The area \(A\) of one triangle can be calculated as:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 7\sqrt{2} \times \frac{7}{2} = \frac{49\sqrt{2}}{4}
   \]
   This confirms the triangles are congruent.

4. **Perimeter Calculation**: The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle consists of the two legs and the base:
   - The legs are both equal to the side length of the square, which is \(7\) inches.
   - The base is the diagonal, which is \(7\sqrt{2}\).

   Therefore, the perimeter is:
   \[
   P = 7 + 7 + 7\sqrt{2} = 14 + 7\sqrt{2}
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: The perimeter of one of the triangles is:
\[
\boxed{14 + 7\sqrt{2}}
\]

**Conclusion**: The simplified solution provided was incorrect in its final answer format. The correct perimeter of one triangle is \(14 + 7\sqrt{2}\), which is now correctly stated in the final answer.","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.0226482
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: There are three teams of four players each. Each player shakes hands three times with every member of the opposing teams and once with each member of their own team.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculation Mistakes**:
   - Each team has 4 players, so there are \(3 \times 4 = 12\) players in total.
   - Each player shakes hands with 3 members of each of the 2 opposing teams. Therefore, each player shakes hands with \(3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24\) players from the opposing teams.
   - Each player also shakes hands once with each of their own 3 teammates, resulting in \(3\) additional handshakes.
   - Thus, each player participates in \(24 + 3 = 27\) handshakes.

3. **Total Handshakes Calculation**:
   - Since there are 12 players, the total number of handshakes is \(12 \times 27 = 324\).
   - However, since each handshake involves two players, we must divide by 2 to avoid double counting. Therefore, the total number of unique handshakes is \(\frac{324}{2} = 162\).

4. **Final Answer**: The total number of handshakes is \(\boxed{162}\).

**Correction Summary**: The original solution incorrectly calculated the total handshakes without accounting for double counting. The corrected total is \(162\).","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","Let's analyze the problem and the simplified solution step by step.

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: Tom has various components for Mr. Potato Head, and we need to calculate the total number of different combinations of these components, including the option to be bald (no hair).

2. **Components Breakdown**:
   - **Hairstyles**: 3 options (including bald)
   - **Eyebrows**: 2 options
   - **Eyes**: 1 option
   - **Ears**: 2 options
   - **Lips**: 2 options
   - **Shoes**: 2 options (regular and clown)

3. **Logical Structure**: 
   - For hairstyles, since Mr. Potato Head can be bald, we have 3 hairstyles + 1 bald option = 4 options.
   - The other components are straightforward as they have fixed options.

4. **Calculation**:
   - Total combinations = (number of hairstyles) × (number of eyebrows) × (number of eyes) × (number of ears) × (number of lips) × (number of shoes)
   - Total combinations = \(4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2\)

5. **Performing the Calculation**:
   - \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
   - \(8 \times 1 = 8\)
   - \(8 \times 2 = 16\)
   - \(16 \times 2 = 32\)
   - \(32 \times 2 = 64\)

6. **Final Verification**: The calculation is correct, and all components have been accounted for properly.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We need to find whole numbers between 100 and 999 (inclusive) that contain exactly one digit '0'.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculation Mistakes**: 
   - The range specified is from 100 to 999, not 99 to 999. This means we should only consider three-digit numbers.
