"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","Let's verify the refined solution step by step:

1. **Check if all the given information in the problem is used correctly**:
   - The problem states that there are two congruent acute angles and that the other three angles are each equal to the sum of the two acute angles. The solution correctly defines \( x \) as the measure of each acute angle and \( 2x \) as the measure of each of the other three angles.

2. **Verify that each step in the solution logically follows from the previous one**:
   - The solution starts by defining the angles, then correctly calculates the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon, and sets up the equation based on the angle definitions. Each step logically follows.

3. **Ensure that all calculations are accurate**:
   - The calculation for the sum of the interior angles is correct: \( 540^\circ \).
   - The equation \( 2x + 3(2x) = 540^\circ \) simplifies correctly to \( 8x = 540^\circ \).
   - Solving for \( x \) gives \( x = 67.5^\circ \), which is accurate.
   - The calculation for the large angles \( 2x = 135^\circ \) is also correct.

4. **Confirm that the final answer addresses the specific question asked in the problem**:
   - The final answer states the common measure of the large angles, which is what the problem asks for.

5. **Verify that the final answer is formatted correctly using LaTeX notation enclosed in \(\boxed{}\)**:

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","Let's verify the refined solution step by step:

### Step 1: Check if all given information is used correctly
- The problem states that good workers can paint the house in 12 hours and bad workers in 36 hours. The solution correctly identifies the work rates:
  - Good worker: \( \frac{1}{12} \) houses per hour.
  - Bad worker: \( \frac{1}{36} \) houses per hour.
- The solution also correctly states that there are 3 good workers and the house needs to be painted in 3 hours.

### Step 2: Verify logical flow of each step
- The solution logically calculates the total work done by the good workers in 3 hours, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \) houses.
- It then calculates the remaining work, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \) houses.
- The work done by the bad workers is set up correctly to find how many are needed to complete the remaining work.

### Step 3: Ensure calculations are accurate
- Total work by good workers:
  \[
  3 \times \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} \times 3 = \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses}
  \]
- Remaining work:
  \[
  1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses}
  \]
- Total work by bad workers:
  \[
  n \times \frac{1}{36} \times 3 = \frac{n}{12} \text{ houses}
  \]
- Setting up the equation:
  \[
  \frac{n}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
  \]
- Solving for \( n \):
  \[
  n = 12 \times \frac{1}{4} = 3
  \]

### Step 4: Confirm final answer addresses the question
- The final answer states that 3 bad workers are needed, which directly answers the question posed in the problem.

### Step 5: Verify final answer formatting
- The final answer is formatted correctly in LaTeX notation.

Since all steps are verified to be correct, the final answer is:

Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.
