        "question": "A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
        "right_answer": "Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.

The key is to consider all possible groupings of the numbers \\(2, 3, 4, 5\\) and how they can be combined using multiplication.\n\n4. **Possible Groupings**:\n   The possible ways to group the numbers can be represented as:\n   - \\((a \\cdot b) \\cdot (c \\cdot d)\\)\n   - \\((a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)) \\cdot d\\)\n   - \\(a \\cdot (b \\cdot (c \\cdot d))\\)\n   - And other combinations.\n\n5. **Generating Values**:\n   We can systematically generate all possible values by considering each way to insert parentheses. The multiplication operation is associative, meaning the order of multiplication does not change the result, but the grouping can lead to different intermediate results.\n\n6. **Distinct Values Calculation**:\n   We will calculate the distinct values obtained from different groupings:\n   - For example:\n     - \\((2 \\cdot 3) \\cdot (4 \\cdot 5) = 6 \\cdot 20 = 120\\)\n     - \\((2 \\cdot (3 \\cdot 4)) \\cdot 5 = (2 \\cdot 12) \\cdot 5 = 24 \\cdot 5 = 120\\)\n     - \\((2 \\cdot 3) \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 = 6 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 = 120\\)\n     - \\((2 \\cdot (3 \\cdot (4 \\cdot 5))) = 2 \\cdot 60 = 120\\)\n     - \\((2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4) \\cdot 5 = 24 \\cdot 5 = 120\\)\n     - \\((2 \\cdot 3) \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 = 6 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 = 120\\)\n     - \\((2 \\cdot (3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5)) = 2 \\cdot 60 = 120\\)\n\n   After exploring all combinations, we find that the only distinct value from the multiplications is 120.\n\n7. **Final Calculation**:\n   Adding 1 to the distinct multiplication results gives:\n   \\[\n   120 + 1 = 121\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter analyzing all possible groupings and their results, we find that the only distinct value obtained from the expression \\(2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 + 1\\) by inserting parentheses is 121.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{121}\n\\]",

For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\\times$ 1 $\\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.",
        "right_answer": "Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\\cdot11\\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \\begin{align*}\n(5)\\cdot (11) \\cdot (13) &= 5\\cdot 11\\cdot 13 \\\\\n(5\\cdot11)\\cdot 13&=55\\cdot 13 \\\\\n5\\cdot(11\\cdot 13) &= 5\\cdot 143 \\\\\n(5\\cdot 13) \\cdot 11 &= 65 \\cdot 11\\text{, and}\\\\\n(5\\cdot11\\cdot13)&=715,\n\\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.

        "model_output": "To solve the problem of finding a common English word with a product value of 715, we will follow a systematic approach. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Letter Values\nWe assign values to letters as follows:\n- A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Product Value of a Word\nThe product value of a word is calculated by multiplying the values of its letters. For example, for the word \"CAB\":\n- C = 3, A = 1, B = 2\n- Product value = \\(3 \\times 1 \\times 2 = 6\\).\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Target Product Value\nWe are looking for a word whose product value equals 715.\n\n### Step 4: Factorization of 715\nTo find potential combinations of letters that yield a product of 715, we first factor 715:\n- \\(715 = 5 \\times 143\\)\n- \\(143 = 11 \\times 13\\)\n\nThus, the prime factorization of 715 is:\n\\[\n715 = 5 \\times 11 \\times 13\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Mapping Factors to Letters\nNext, we map these factors to their corresponding letters:\n- 5 corresponds to E\n- 11 corresponds to K\n- 13 corresponds to M\n\n### Step 6: Forming Words\nThe letters E, K, and M can be combined in various ways to form words.

However, we need to ensure that the output is correct and that the words returned are indeed common English words with the specified product value.\n\n### Code Review\n\nThe code provided is mostly correct. It defines functions to calculate letter values and product values, fetches common words, and checks for the target product. The output from the code is:\n```python\n['kame', 'make', 'meak']\n```\n\n### Verification of Output\n\nNow, let's verify the product values of the returned words:\n\n- **kame**:\n  \\[\n  k = 11, a = 1, m = 13, e = 5 \\implies 11 \\times 1 \\times 13 \\times 5 = 715\n  \\]\n\n- **make**:\n  \\[\n  m = 13, a = 1, k = 11, e = 5 \\implies 13 \\times 1 \\times 11 \\times 5 = 715\n  \\]\n\n- **meak**:\n  \\[\n  m = 13, e = 5, a = 1, k = 11 \\implies 13 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 11 = 715\n  \\]\n\nAll three words indeed have a product value of 715.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThus, the common English words with a product value of 715 are:\n\\[\n\\text{Words: } \\{ \\text{kame}, \\text{make}, \\text{meak} \\}\n\\]\n\nIn LaTeX notation, the final answer can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\boxed{715}\n\\] \n\nThis indicates that the product value we were looking for is indeed 715, and the words that achieve this value are confirmed.",
