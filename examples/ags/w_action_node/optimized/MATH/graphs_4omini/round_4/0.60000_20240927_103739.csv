"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given information about the convex pentagon and derive the measures of its angles step-by-step.

1. **Understanding the Angles**:
   - Let \( x \) be the measure of each of the two congruent acute angles.
   - According to the problem, the measure of each of the other three angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. Therefore, each of these three angles measures \( 2x \).

2. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
     \]
     where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, \( n = 5 \):
     \[
     \text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
     \]

3. **Formulating the Equation**:
   - The total sum of the angles in the pentagon can be expressed as:
     \[
     2x + 3(2x) = 540^\circ
     \]
   - Simplifying this equation:
     \[
     2x + 6x = 540^\circ
     \]
     \[
     8x = 540^\circ
     \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), divide both sides by 8:
     \[
     x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
     \]

5. **Finding the Measure of the Large Angles**:
   - The measure of each of the large angles (which are \( 2x \)) is:
     \[
     2x = 2 \times 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, the common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is:
     \[
     \boxed{135}
     \]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.012303149999999999

label(""$n-1$"",(2.5,2.5));
[/asy]","To solve the problem of finding the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sums of each row, each column, and the two main diagonals are equal. We will start by calculating the sums of the rows and then set up equations to find \( n \).

### Step 1: Calculate the sums of each row

1. **Row 1**: 
   \[
   (n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
   \]

2. **Row 2**: 
   \[
   3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
   \]

3. **Row 3**: 
   \[
   (n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

### Step 2: Set up equations for the row sums

Since the sums of Row 1 and Row 2 must be equal, we can set up the first equation:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Rearranging this gives:
\[
2n + 1 - 3n + 6 = 0 \implies -n + 7 = 0 \implies n = 7
\]

Next, we check the equality of Row 1 and Row 3:
\[
2n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
This equation is always true, confirming that Row 1 and Row 3 are equal for any \( n \).

### Step 3: Verify the value of \( n \)

Now, we will substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square to ensure that all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to the same value.

1. **Row 1**:
   \[
   (7 - 3) + (7 + 2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
   \]

2. **Row 2**:
   \[
   3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 14 - 9 + 7 = 15
   \]

3. **Row 3**:
   \[
   (7 + 1) + 1 + (7 - 1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
   \]

### Step 4: Check the columns

1. **Column 1**:
   \[
   (7 - 3) + 3 + (7 + 1) = 4 + 3 + 8 = 15
   \]

2. **Column 2**:
   \[
   (7 + 2) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 9 + 5 + 7 = 21 \quad \text{(This is incorrect)}
   \]

3. **Column 3**:
   \[
   2 + 1 + (7 - 1) = 2 + 1 + 6 = 9 \quad \text{(This is incorrect)}
   \]

### Conclusion

The calculations show that while the rows sum to 15, the columns do not. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our approach. 

### Final Answer

After checking the calculations and ensuring that the magic square properties hold, we conclude that the value of \( n \) that satisfies the conditions of the magic square is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\] 

However, since the columns did not match, we need to re-evaluate the values in the square or the conditions of the problem. The value of \( n \) is indeed \( 7 \) based on the row calculations, but further adjustments may be needed to ensure the entire square is a valid magic square.","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem of how many bad workers are needed to paint the house in 3 hours, given that we have 3 good workers, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the Work Rates of Workers

1. **Good Worker**: Each good worker can paint the house in 12 hours. Therefore, the work rate of one good worker is:
   \[
   \text{Work rate of good worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
   \]

2. **Bad Worker**: Each bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours. Therefore, the work rate of one bad worker is:
   \[
   \text{Work rate of bad worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Work Done by Good Workers

We have 3 good workers. The total work done by these workers in 3 hours is:
\[
\text{Total work by good workers} = \text{Number of good workers} \times \text{Work rate of good worker} \times \text{Time}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Total work by good workers} = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} \times 3 = \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Remaining Work

The total work needed to paint the house is 1 house. The remaining work that needs to be done by bad workers is:
\[
\text{Remaining work} = \text{Total work needed} - \text{Total work by good workers}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Remaining work} = 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Work Done by Bad Workers

Let \( n \) be the number of bad workers needed. The total work done by \( n \) bad workers in 3 hours is:
\[
\text{Total work by bad workers} = n \times \text{Work rate of bad worker} \times \text{Time}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Total work by bad workers} = n \times \frac{1}{36} \times 3 = \frac{n}{12} \text{ houses}
\]

### Step 5: Set Up the Equation

To find the number of bad workers needed, we set the total work done by bad workers equal to the remaining work:
\[
\frac{n}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 6: Solve for \( n \)

To solve for \( n \), we multiply both sides by 12:
\[
n = 12 \times \frac{1}{4} = 3
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the number of bad workers needed to complete the painting of the house in 3 hours, alongside the 3 good workers, is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.01342815
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To solve the problem of finding a common English word with a product value of 715, we will follow a systematic approach. The product value of a word is calculated by multiplying the values assigned to each letter, where A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding Letter Values**:
   Each letter corresponds to a numerical value:
   - A = 1
   - B = 2
   - C = 3
   - ...
   - Z = 26

2. **Calculating Product Value**:
   The product value of a word is the product of the values of its letters. For example, for the word ""CAB"":
   \[
   \text{Product Value} = C \times A \times B = 3 \times 1 \times 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Target Product**:
   We are looking for a word whose product value equals 715.

4. **Factorization of 715**:
   To find potential combinations of letters that yield a product of 715, we can factor 715:
   \[
   715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
   \]
   This means we need to find letters corresponding to these values:
   - 5 = E
   - 11 = K
   - 13 = M

5. **Forming Words**:
   The letters E, K, and M can be rearranged to form the word ""MEK"" or ""KEM"". However, we need to check if these are common English words.

6. **Checking Common Words**:
   We can check a list of common English words to see if any of the combinations of E, K, and M form a valid word. 

7. **Finding Valid Combinations**:
   The combinations of the letters E, K, and M are:
   - MEK
   - KEM
   - EMK
   - MKE
   - KME
   - EKM

   Among these, ""MEK"" and ""KEM"" are not standard English words. However, we can also consider the possibility of using other letters that multiply to 715.

8. **Exploring Other Combinations**:
   We can also explore combinations of letters that might yield the same product. For example, we can check combinations of letters that multiply to 715, such as:
   - 7 (G)
   - 15 (O)
   - 1 (A)
   - 5 (E)
   - 11 (K)
   - 13 (M)

   After checking various combinations, we find that the word ""GOLD"" has a product value of:
   \[
   G (7) \times O (15) \times L (12) \times D (4) = 7 \times 15 \times 12 \times 4 = 7 \times 15 = 105 \times 12 = 1260 \text{ (not valid)}
   \]

   Continuing this process, we find that the word ""MEGA"" has a product value of:
   \[
   M (13) \times E (5) \times G (7) \times A (1) = 13 \times 5 \times 7 \times 1 = 455 \text{ (not valid)}
   \]

   After checking various combinations, we find that the word ""KID"" has a product value of:
   \[
   K (11) \times I (9) \times D (4) = 11 \times 9 \times 4 = 396 \text{ (not valid)}
   \]

   Finally, we find that the word ""MEG"" has a product value of:
   \[
   M (13) \times E (5) \times G (7) = 13 \times 5 \times 7 = 455 \text{ (not valid)}
   \]

9. **Final Check**:
   After checking various combinations, we find that the word ""GEM"" has a product value of:
   \[
   G (7) \times E (5) \times M (13) = 7 \times 5 \times 13 = 455 \text{ (not valid)}

Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"To solve the problem of estimating \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the square of the number**: We need to compute \( 14.7923412^2 \).
2. **Round the result to the nearest hundred**: After calculating the square, we will round the result to the nearest hundred.

### Step 1: Calculate the square of the number

We start with the number \( 14.7923412 \):

\[
14.7923412^2 = 14.7923412 \times 14.7923412
\]

Using a calculator or performing the multiplication, we find:

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem, we need to analyze the situation step-by-step, ensuring all calculations are correct and clearly explained.

### Step 1: Determine the Side Length of the Square
The area of the square is given as \(49\) square inches. The formula for the area of a square is:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{side length}^2
\]

Let \(s\) be the side length of the square. We can find \(s\) by taking the square root of the area:

\[
s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Understand the Folding Process
When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, it creates two congruent right triangles. The legs of these triangles are formed by folding the square in half.

### Step 3: Calculate the Legs of the Triangle
When the square is folded, the legs of the triangle are each half the side length of the square. Therefore, the lengths of the legs \(a\) and \(b\) of the triangle are:

\[
a = b = \frac{s}{2} = \frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Hypotenuse of the Triangle
Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the hypotenuse \(c\) of the triangle:

\[
c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{(3.5)^2 + (3.5)^2}
\]

Calculating \(a^2\) and \(b^2\):

\[
(3.5)^2 = 12.25
\]

Thus,

\[
c = \sqrt{12.25 + 12.25} = \sqrt{24.5} = \sqrt{24.5} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 6.125} = 2\sqrt{6.125}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Perimeter of One Triangle
The perimeter \(P\) of one of the triangles is the sum of the lengths of its three sides:

\[
P = a + b + c = 3.5 + 3.5 + 2\sqrt{6.125}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
P = 7 + 2\sqrt{6.125}
\]

### Step 6: Simplify \(\sqrt{6.125}\)
To express \(\sqrt{6.125}\) in simplest radical form, we can rewrite \(6.125\) as:

\[
6.125 = \frac{49}{8} \quad \text{(since } 6.125 = 6 + 0.125 = 6 + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{48}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{49}{8}\text{)}
\]

Thus,

\[
\sqrt{6.125} = \sqrt{\frac{49}{8}} = \frac{7}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{7}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{4}
\]

### Step 7: Substitute Back into the Perimeter
Now substituting back into the perimeter:

\[
P = 7 + 2\left(\frac{7\sqrt{2}}{4}\right) = 7 + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

### Final Answer
The perimeter of one of the triangles, expressed in simplest radical form, is:

\[
\boxed{7 + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}}
\]","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.012835049999999999
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of counting the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships, we will break down the calculations step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the Setup
- There are **3 teams**.
- Each team has **4 players**.
- Each player shakes hands:
  - **Once** with each member of their own team.
  - **Three times** with each member of the opposing teams.

### Step 2: Calculate Total Players
The total number of players can be calculated as:
\[
\text{Total Players} = \text{Number of Teams} \times \text{Players per Team} = 3 \times 4 = 12
\]

### Step 3: Handshakes Within Own Team
Each player shakes hands with their own team members. Since there are 4 players in a team, each player shakes hands with:
\[
\text{Handshakes with Own Team} = \text{Players per Team} - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3
\]
Thus, the total handshakes within a team (for all players) is:
\[
\text{Total Handshakes Own Team} = \text{Number of Players in Team} \times \text{Handshakes with Own Team} = 4 \times 3 = 12
\]
Since there are 3 teams, the total handshakes within all teams is:
\[
\text{Total Handshakes Own Teams} = 3 \times 12 = 36
\]

### Step 4: Handshakes with Opposing Teams
Each player shakes hands **three times** with each member of the opposing teams. Each player has:
\[
\text{Opposing Players} = \text{Total Players} - \text{Players in Own Team} = 12 - 4 = 8
\]
Thus, the total handshakes with opposing players for one player is:
\[
\text{Total Handshakes with Opposing Teams} = \text{Opposing Players} \times 3 = 8 \times 3 = 24
\]
For all players, the total handshakes with opposing teams is:
\[
\text{Total Handshakes Opposing Teams} = \text{Total Players} \times \text{Total Handshakes with Opposing Teams} = 12 \times 24 = 288
\]

### Step 5: Calculate Total Handshakes
Now, we can sum the handshakes from both within the teams and with opposing teams:
\[
\text{Total Handshakes} = \text{Total Handshakes Own Teams} + \text{Total Handshakes Opposing Teams} = 36 + 288 = 324
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships is:
\[
\boxed{324}
\]","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

There are 12 players in total, which offers $12\times27=324$ handshakes, but since a handshake takes place between two people, we've counted every handshake twice.

"The expression $2\cdot 3 \cdot 4\cdot 5+1$ is equal to 121, since multiplication is carried out before addition. However, we can obtain values other than 121 for this expression if we are allowed to change it by inserting parentheses. For example, we can obtain 144 by writing \[
(2\cdot (3\cdot 4)) \cdot (5+1) = 144.
\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).","To solve the problem of how many distinct values can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses, we need to analyze the expression and the possible ways to group the multiplications.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Understanding the Expression**:
   The original expression is:
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1
   \]
   The multiplication is performed first, followed by the addition of 1.

2. **Calculating the Original Value**:
   First, we calculate the value of the expression without any parentheses:
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 = 6
   \]
   \[
   6 \cdot 4 = 24
   \]
   \[
   24 \cdot 5 = 120
   \]
   Adding 1 gives:
   \[
   120 + 1 = 121
   \]

3. **Inserting Parentheses**:
   We can insert parentheses in various ways to change the order of operations. The key is to consider all possible groupings of the numbers \(2, 3, 4, 5\) and how they can be combined using multiplication.

4. **Possible Groupings**:
   The possible ways to group the numbers can be represented as:
   - \((a \cdot b) \cdot (c \cdot d)\)
   - \((a \cdot (b \cdot c)) \cdot d\)
   - \(a \cdot (b \cdot (c \cdot d))\)
   - And other combinations.

5. **Generating Values**:
   We can systematically generate all possible values by considering each way to insert parentheses. The multiplication operation is associative, meaning the order of multiplication does not change the result, but the grouping can lead to different intermediate results.

6. **Distinct Values Calculation**:
   We will calculate the distinct values obtained from different groupings:
   - For example:
     - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 6 \cdot 20 = 120\)
     - \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 = (2 \cdot 12) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120\)
     - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 120\)
     - \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5))) = 2 \cdot 60 = 120\)
     - \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120\)
     - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 120\)
     - \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5)) = 2 \cdot 60 = 120\)

   After exploring all combinations, we find that the only distinct value from the multiplications is 120.

7. **Final Calculation**:
   Adding 1 to the distinct multiplication results gives:
   \[
   120 + 1 = 121
   \]

### Conclusion
After analyzing all possible groupings and their results, we find that the only distinct value obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses is 121.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{121}
\]","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.

"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To solve the problem of how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we need to consider the various components and their combinations. Let's break down the components step-by-step:

1. **Components Available**:
   - **Hairstyles**: 3 options (plus the option to be bald, which adds 1 more option)
   - **Eyebrows**: 2 options
   - **Eyes**: 1 option (googly eyes)
   - **Ears**: 2 options
   - **Lips**: 2 options
   - **Shoes**: 2 options (1 pair of regular shoes and 1 pair of clown shoes)

2. **Calculating Options**:
   - For hairstyles, since Mr. Potato Head can be bald, the total options for hairstyles are:
     \[
     \text{Hairstyles} = 3 + 1 = 4
     \]
   - The other components have the following options:
     - Eyebrows: 2
     - Eyes: 1
     - Ears: 2
     - Lips: 2
     - Shoes: 2

3. **Total Combinations**:
   To find the total number of different personalities, we multiply the number of options for each component:
   \[
   \text{Total Personalities} = (\text{Hairstyles}) \times (\text{Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Eyes}) \times (\text{Ears}) \times (\text{Lips}) \times (\text{Shoes})
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total Personalities} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
   \]

4. **Performing the Calculation**:
   Let's calculate this step-by-step:
   - First, calculate \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
   - Next, \(8 \times 1 = 8\)
   - Then, \(8 \times 2 = 16\)
   - Next, \(16 \times 2 = 32\)
   - Finally, \(32 \times 2 = 64\)

Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities that Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head is:

\[
\boxed{64}
\]","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.011046449999999998
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To solve the problem of finding how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one '0', we can break down the solution step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define the Range
We are interested in whole numbers between 100 and 999 (inclusive). This is because the problem specifies numbers between 99 and 999, and the smallest three-digit number is 100.

### Step 2: Identify the Structure of the Numbers
A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
- \(a\) is the hundreds digit (can be from 1 to 9),
- \(b\) is the tens digit (can be from 0 to 9),
- \(c\) is the units digit (can be from 0 to 9).

### Step 3: Conditions for Exactly One '0'
For a number to contain exactly one '0', we have three possible cases based on the position of '0':
1. \(a = 0\) (not possible since \(a\) must be from 1 to 9).
2. \(b = 0\) and \(c \neq 0\).
3. \(c = 0\) and \(b \neq 0\).

### Step 4: Count Valid Combinations
#### Case 1: \(b = 0\) and \(c \neq 0\)
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(b\) is fixed as 0.
- \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \text{ (choices for } a\text{)} \times 1 \text{ (fixed } b\text{)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for } c\text{)} = 81.
\]

#### Case 2: \(c = 0\) and \(b \neq 0\)
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(b\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(c\) is fixed as 0.

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \text{ (choices for } a\text{)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for } b\text{)} \times 1 \text{ (fixed } c\text{)} = 81.
\]

### Step 5: Combine the Results
Now, we add the results from both cases:
\[
81 \text{ (from case 1)} + 81 \text{ (from case 2)} = 162.
\]

### Final Answer
The total number of whole numbers between 99 and 999 that contain exactly one '0' is:
