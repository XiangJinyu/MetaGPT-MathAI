"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Review the problem statement**: We have a convex pentagon with two congruent acute angles, and the other three angles are each equal to the sum of the two acute angles.

2. **Check for logical errors**: 
   - Let the measure of each acute angle be \( x \). Thus, the two acute angles contribute \( 2x \) to the total angle sum.
   - The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by \( (5-2) \times 180 = 540 \) degrees.
   - The three larger angles, each equal to \( 2x \), contribute \( 3(2x) = 6x \) to the total angle sum.

3. **Set up the equation**:
   \[
   2x + 6x = 540
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   8x = 540 \implies x = \frac{540}{8} = 67.5
   \]

4. **Calculate the larger angles**: Each of the larger angles is \( 2x = 2 \times 67.5 = 135 \) degrees.

5. **Verify the solution**: 
   - The two acute angles are \( 67.5 \) degrees each.
   - The three larger angles are \( 135 \) degrees each.
   - The total is \( 2(67.5) + 3(135) = 135 + 405 = 540 \) degrees, which is correct.

6. **Final answer**: The solution correctly addresses all aspects of the problem, and no errors were found.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.021059400000000002

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: We have a 3x3 magic square with specific values involving \( n \). The goal is to find the value of \( n \) such that the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals are equal.

2. **Check for Errors**: 
   - The values in the magic square are:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
     3 & 2n-9 & n \\
     n+1 & 1 & n-1

     \]
   - The sum of the second row is:
     \[
     3 + (2n-9) + n = 3n - 6
     \]
   - The sum of the third row is:
     \[
     (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = 2n + 1
     \]
   - Setting the sums of the first and second rows equal gives:
     \[
     2n + 1 = 3n - 6

     Solving this:
     \[
     1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies n = 7

     - Other diagonal:
       \[
       2 + (2n-9) + (n+1) = 3n - 6
       \]
   - Setting the diagonal sums equal to the row sums:
     \[
     4n - 13 = 2n + 1 \implies 2n = 14 \implies n = 7
     \]

4. **Final Verification**: All calculations confirm that \( n = 7 \) satisfies the conditions of the magic square.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","Let's perform the error analysis on the simplified solution.

1. **Review the problem statement**: We need to find out how many bad workers are required to complete the painting of the house in 3 hours, given that we have 3 good workers.

2. **Check for logical errors and calculations**:
   - Each good worker can paint the house in 12 hours, so their rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of the house per hour.
   - With 3 good workers, their combined rate is:
     \[
     3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the house per hour.}
     \]
   - Each bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours, so their rate is \( \frac{1}{36} \) of the house per hour.
   - Let \( b \) be the number of bad workers. Their combined rate is:
     \[
     b \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{b}{36} \text{ of the house per hour.}
     \]

3. **Total rate needed**: To finish painting the house in 3 hours, the total work done must equal 1 house. Therefore, the total rate needed is:
   \[
   \frac{1 \text{ house}}{3 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ of the house per hour.}
   \]

4. **Set up the equation**:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} + \frac{b}{36} = \frac{1}{3}.
   \]

5. **Solve for \( b \)**:
   - To solve this equation, first find a common denominator, which is 36:
   \[
   \frac{9}{36} + \frac{b}{36} = \frac{12}{36}.
   \]
   - This simplifies to:
   \[
   9 + b = 12.
   \]
   - Thus, we find:
   \[
   b = 12 - 9 = 3.
   \]

6. **Final verification**: The calculations confirm that 3 bad workers are indeed required to meet the painting deadline.

Since no errors were found in the calculations or logic, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.

Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.022909350000000002

What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","Let's analyze the problem and the simplified solution step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We need to find a common English word whose product value equals 715, where the product value is calculated by multiplying the values assigned to each letter (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26).

2. **Simplified Solution Review**: The simplified solution states that there is ""None"" as the answer.

3. **Logical Errors and Calculation Mistakes**: 
   - We need to factor 715 to see if it can be represented as a product of letter values.
   - The prime factorization of 715 is \(5 \times 11 \times 13\).
   - The corresponding letter values are:
     - 5 = E
     - 11 = K
     - 13 = M
   - Therefore, the word ""EKM"" has a product value of \(5 \times 11 \times 13 = 715\).

4. **Addressing All Aspects**: The solution must consider that ""EKM"" is a valid combination of letters that yields the required product value.

5. **Final Answer**: Since we found a valid word, the previous conclusion of ""None"" is incorrect. The correct answer is ""EKM"".

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{EKM}}
\]","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have a square piece of paper with an area of \(49\) square inches. This means each side of the square is \(7\) inches (since \(7^2 = 49\)). When folded, two opposite corners coincide, forming two congruent triangles.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculations**: When the square is folded, the diagonal of the square becomes the base of the triangles formed. The length of the diagonal \(d\) of the square can be calculated using the formula \(d = s\sqrt{2}\), where \(s\) is the side length. Thus, \(d = 7\sqrt{2}\).

3. **Triangle Dimensions**: Each triangle has a base equal to the diagonal of the square, which is \(7\sqrt{2}\), and a height equal to half the side length of the square, which is \(3.5\) inches.

4. **Perimeter Calculation**: The two legs of the triangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. Each leg is the distance from the midpoint of the base to the corners of the square. The legs are both equal to \(7\) inches (the side of the square). Therefore, the perimeter \(P\) of one triangle is:
   \[
   P = \text{base} + 2 \times \text{leg} = 7\sqrt{2} + 2 \times 7 = 7\sqrt{2} + 14.
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: The perimeter of one of the triangles is expressed in simplest radical form as:
   \[
   \boxed{7\sqrt{2} + 14}.
   \]

No errors were found in the calculations, and the final answer is correctly formatted.","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.023190000000000002

How many handshakes are there in total?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: There are three teams of four players each. Each player shakes hands three times with every member of the opposing teams and once with each member of their own team.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculation Mistakes**:
   - Each team has 4 players, so there are \(3 \times 4 = 12\) players in total.
   - Each player shakes hands with:
     - **Own Team**: 3 handshakes (since they shake hands once with each of the 3 other members of their team).
     - **Opposing Teams**: There are 2 opposing teams, each with 4 players, leading to \(4 \times 2 = 8\) players. Each player shakes hands 3 times with each of these 8 players.

3. **Total Handshakes Calculation**:
   - Handshakes with own team: Each of the 12 players shakes hands 3 times with 3 teammates:
     \[
     12 \text{ players} \times 3 \text{ handshakes} = 36 \text{ handshakes}
     \]
   - Handshakes with opposing teams: Each of the 12 players shakes hands 3 times with 8 opposing players:
     \[
     12 \text{ players} \times 8 \text{ opposing players} \times 3 \text{ handshakes} = 288 \text{ handshakes}
     \]

4. **Total Handshakes**:
   - Adding both contributions:
   \[
   36 + 288 = 324 \text{ total handshakes}

5. **Final Answer**: The corrected total number of handshakes is \(\boxed{324}\).","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

   - Hairstyles: 3 options (including bald)
   - Eyebrows: 2 sets
   - Eyes: 1 set
   - Ears: 2 sets
   - Lips: 2 sets
   - Shoes: 2 options (regular and clown)

   - For eyes, there is 1 option.
   - For ears, there are 2 options.
   - For lips, there are 2 options.
   - For shoes, there are 2 options.

4. **Calculating the total combinations**:

How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"Let's analyze the problem of finding how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We need to find whole numbers between 100 and 999 (inclusive) that contain exactly one digit '0'.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculation Mistakes**: 
   - The range specified is from 100 to 999, not 99 to 999. This means we should only consider three-digit numbers.
   - A three-digit number can have a '0' in either the tens or the units place, but not in the hundreds place (as it would then not be a three-digit number).

3. **Special Conditions**: 
   - The hundreds digit can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
   - The tens digit can be '0' (1 option) or any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
