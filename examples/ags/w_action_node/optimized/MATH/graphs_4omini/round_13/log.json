        "question": "A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
        "right_answer": "Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\\sqrt{2} = \\boxed{14+7\\sqrt{2}}$.",
        "model_output": "Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.\n\n1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have a square piece of paper with an area of \\(49\\) square inches. This means the side length of the square is \\(7\\) inches (since \\(7^2 = 49\\)). When folded, two opposite corners coincide, forming two congruent triangles.\n\n2. **Logical Errors and Calculations**: \n   - When the square is folded, the diagonal of the square becomes the base of the triangles formed. The length of the diagonal \\(d\\) of the square can be calculated using the formula \\(d = s\\sqrt{2}\\), where \\(s\\) is the side length. Thus, \\(d = 7\\sqrt{2}\\).\n   - The height of each triangle is half the side length of the square, which is \\(3.5\\) inches.\n\n3. **Area of the Triangle**: The area \\(A\\) of one triangle can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 7\\sqrt{2} \\times 3.5 = \\frac{49\\sqrt{2}}{4} = \\frac{49\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\text{ square inches.}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perimeter Calculation**: The perimeter \\(P\\) of one triangle consists of the two legs and the base:\n   - The base is \\(7\\sqrt{2}\\).\n   - Each leg can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.
