"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We have a convex pentagon with two congruent acute angles and three other angles, each equal to the sum of the two acute angles. We need to find the measure of these larger angles.

### Step 2: Break Down the Problem
Let:
- \( x \) be the measure of each of the two congruent acute angles.
- The measure of each of the three larger angles will then be \( 2x \) (since each larger angle is equal to the sum of the two acute angles).

### Step 3: Identify Key Information
1. The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)):
   \[
   \text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
   \]

2. The angles in the pentagon can be expressed as:
   - Two angles of \( x \)
   - Three angles of \( 2x \)

### Step 4: Set Up the Equation
The total sum of the angles can be expressed as:
\[
2x + 3(2x) = 540^\circ
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 6x = 540^\circ
\]
\[
8x = 540^\circ
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
Now, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
\]

### Step 6: Find the Measure of the Larger Angles
The measure of each of the larger angles is:
\[
2x = 2 \times 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ
\]

### Step 7: Final Answer
Thus, the common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is:
\[
\boxed{135^\circ}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",0,0.00968895

[/asy]","To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \( n \) in the given magic square. A magic square is defined such that the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are equal.

### Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Magic Square

The magic square is structured as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 2: Identify Key Information

We need to find the common sum \( S \) of each row, column, and diagonal. We will set up equations based on the sums of the rows.

### Step 3: Set Up Equations

1. **First Row:**
   \[
   (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
   \]

2. **Second Row:**
   \[
   3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
   \]

3. **Third Row:**
   \[
   (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

### Step 4: Set the Row Sums Equal

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we can set the first and second rows equal to each other:

\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( n \)

Rearranging the equation:

\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \implies 1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n
\]

### Step 6: Verify the Solution

Now, we will verify that \( n = 7 \) satisfies the magic square condition by calculating the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals.

1. **Substituting \( n = 7 \):**
   - First Row: 
     \[
     7 - 3 = 4, \quad 7 + 2 = 9, \quad 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
     \]
   - Second Row:
     \[
     3, \quad 2(7) - 9 = 14 - 9 = 5, \quad 7 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
     \]
   - Third Row:
     \[
     7 + 1 = 8, \quad 1, \quad 7 - 1 = 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
     \]

2. **Column Sums:**
   - First Column:
     \[
     4 + 3 + 8 = 15
     \]
   - Second Column:
     \[
     9 + 5 + 1 = 15
     \]
   - Third Column:
     \[
     2 + 7 + 6 = 15
     \]

3. **Diagonal Sums:**
   - Main Diagonal:
     \[
     4 + 5 + 6 = 15
     \]
   - Other Diagonal:
     \[
     2 + 5 + 8 = 15
     \]

### Final Answer

Since all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to 15, the value of \( n \) is confirmed to be:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to determine how many bad workers are required to help 3 good workers paint a house in 3 hours.

### Step 2: Break Down the Problem
1. Calculate the work rate of good workers.
2. Calculate the work rate of bad workers.
3. Determine the total work needed to paint the house.
4. Set up an equation to find the number of bad workers needed.

### Step 3: Identify Key Information
- Each good worker can paint the house in 12 hours.
- Each bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours.
- We need the house painted in 3 hours.
- We have 3 good workers.

### Step 4: Apply Mathematical Concepts
1. **Calculate the work rate of good workers:**
   - Work rate of one good worker = \( \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour} \)
   - Work rate of 3 good workers = \( 3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses per hour} \)

2. **Calculate the work rate of bad workers:**
   - Work rate of one bad worker = \( \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour} \)

3. **Total work needed:**
   - The total work needed to paint the house is 1 house.

4. **Set up the equation:**
   - Let \( b \) be the number of bad workers.
   - The combined work rate of 3 good workers and \( b \) bad workers in 1 hour is:
     \[
     \text{Total work rate} = \frac{1}{4} + b \cdot \frac{1}{36}
     \]
   - We need this total work rate to complete 1 house in 3 hours, so:
     \[
     3 \left( \frac{1}{4} + b \cdot \frac{1}{36} \right) = 1
     \]

### Step 5: Solve the Equation
1. Distributing the 3:
   \[
   3 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 3b \cdot \frac{1}{36} = 1
   \]
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} + \frac{b}{12} = 1
   \]

2. Subtract \( \frac{3}{4} \) from both sides:
   \[
   \frac{b}{12} = 1 - \frac{3}{4}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{b}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

3. Multiply both sides by 12:
   \[
   b = 12 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 3
   \]

### Step 6: Double-Check Calculations
- Work rate of 3 good workers: \( \frac{1}{4} \) houses/hour.
- Work rate of 3 bad workers: \( 3 \cdot \frac{1}{36} = \frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{12} \) houses/hour.
- Total work rate: \( \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{12} \).
- Finding a common denominator (12):
  \[
  \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}, \quad \text{so} \quad \frac{3}{12} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ houses/hour}
  \]
- In 3 hours, they can paint \( 3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 1 \) house, confirming the calculation is correct.

### Final Answer
To have the house painted in 3 hours, you need to find **3 bad workers**.","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",0,0.014211
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To find a common English word with a product value of 715, we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to find a word such that the product of the values of its letters equals 715. Each letter corresponds to its position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26).

### Step 2: Factor the Number
First, we will factor 715 to find possible combinations of letter values.

### Step 3: Factorization of 715
To factor 715, we can start by checking for divisibility by small prime numbers:

- **Divisibility by 5**: Since 715 ends in 5, it is divisible by 5.
  \[
  715 \div 5 = 143
  \]

- **Next, factor 143**: Check for divisibility by 11 (the next prime number).
  \[
  143 \div 11 = 13
  \]
  
Thus, we have:
\[
715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
\]

### Step 4: Corresponding Letter Values
Now we will convert these factors into their corresponding letter values:
- 5 corresponds to E
- 11 corresponds to K
- 13 corresponds to M

### Step 5: Forming the Word
The letters E, K, and M can be arranged to form the word ""MEK"" or ""KEM"". However, these are not common English words. 

### Step 6: Check for Other Combinations
Since we have the prime factors, we can also consider combinations of these factors with other letters. 

- The letter values can be combined in different ways. For example, we can also consider:
  - 1 (A) can be multiplied with any of the factors without changing the product.
  
### Step 7: Finding a Common Word
We can try to find a common word that includes these letters or their combinations. 

After checking various combinations, we find that the word ""ME"" (M=13, E=5) can be combined with other letters to reach the product of 715. 

However, a more straightforward approach is to check common words that might fit the product value.

### Final Check
After checking various combinations and common words, we find that the word ""MEGA"" (M=13, E=5, G=7, A=1) gives:
\[
13 \times 5 \times 7 \times 1 = 455 \quad \text{(not 715)}
\]

Continuing this process, we find that the word ""KEM"" (K=11, E=5, M=13) gives:
\[
11 \times 5 \times 13 = 715
\]

### Final Answer
The common English word with a product value of 715 is **""KEM""**.","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}
(5)\cdot (11) \cdot (13) &= 5\cdot 11\cdot 13 \\
(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.",0,0.01184355

### Step 2: Calculate the square of the rounded number
Next, we calculate the square of \( 15 \):

\[
15^2 = 15 \times 15 = 225
\]

### Step 3: Estimate the original number's square
Now, we need to check how close \( 14.7923412^2 \) is to \( 15^2 \). We can calculate \( 14.7923412^2 \) directly for comparison, but since we are estimating, we can also consider the effect of the rounding.

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given information and breaking it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We have a square piece of paper with an area of \(49\) square inches. When folded, one pair of opposite corners coincide, creating two congruent triangles upon unfolding.

2. **Finding the Side Length of the Square**: The area of the square is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = s^2
   \]
   where \(s\) is the side length of the square. Given that the area is \(49\) square inches, we can find \(s\):
   \[
   s^2 = 49 \implies s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Visualizing the Fold**: When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, we can visualize the square as having corners at points \(A(0, 0)\), \(B(7, 0)\), \(C(7, 7)\), and \(D(0, 7)\). If we fold the square such that corner \(A\) coincides with corner \(C\), the fold line will be the diagonal \(AC\).

4. **Finding the Triangles**: The fold creates two congruent right triangles. The vertices of one triangle can be identified as:
   - Point \(A(0, 0)\)
   - Point \(B(7, 0)\)
   - The midpoint of the diagonal \(AC\), which is:
     \[
     M = \left(\frac{0 + 7}{2}, \frac{0 + 7}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{7}{2}, \frac{7}{2}\right)
     \]

5. **Calculating the Lengths of the Triangle's Sides**:
   - The length of side \(AB\) is:
     \[
     AB = 7 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - The length of side \(AM\) can be calculated using the distance formula:
     \[
     AM = \sqrt{\left(\frac{7}{2} - 0\right)^2 + \left(\frac{7}{2} - 0\right)^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{7}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{7}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{2 \cdot \left(\frac{7}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{49}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{98}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{98}}{2} = \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}
     \]
   - The length of side \(BM\) is the same as \(AM\) since the triangles are congruent:
     \[
     BM = \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}
     \]

6. **Calculating the Perimeter of One Triangle**: The perimeter \(P\) of triangle \(ABM\) is given by:
   \[
   P = AB + AM + BM = 7 + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2} = 7 + 7\sqrt{2}

7. **Final Answer**: The perimeter of one of the triangles is:
   \[
   \boxed{7 + 7\sqrt{2}} \text{ inches}
   \]","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.0146349
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem, we will break it down into manageable parts and calculate the total number of handshakes.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We have three teams, each consisting of four players. Each player shakes hands three times with every member of the opposing teams and once with each member of their own team.

### Step 2: Identify Key Information
- Number of teams: 3
- Number of players per team: 4
- Handshakes with own team: 1 handshake per player per teammate
- Handshakes with opposing teams: 3 handshakes per player per opponent

### Step 3: Calculate Handshakes Within Own Team
Each player shakes hands with their own teammates. Since there are 4 players in a team, each player shakes hands with 3 teammates.

\[
\text{Handshakes within own team} = \text{Number of players} \times \text{Handshakes per player with teammates}
\]
\[
= 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ handshakes per team}
\]

Since there are 3 teams, the total handshakes within all teams is:
\[
\text{Total handshakes within teams} = 3 \times 12 = 36
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Handshakes with Opposing Teams
Each player shakes hands with players from the other two teams. Each team has 4 players, so each player shakes hands with \(4 + 4 = 8\) players from the opposing teams.

Each player shakes hands 3 times with each of these 8 players:
\[
\text{Handshakes with opposing teams} = \text{Number of players} \times \text{Handshakes per player with opponents}
\]
\[
= 4 \times 8 \times 3 = 96 \text{ handshakes per team}
\]

Since there are 3 teams, the total handshakes with opposing teams is:
\[
\text{Total handshakes with opposing teams} = 3 \times 96 = 288
\]

### Step 5: Calculate Total Handshakes
Now, we add the handshakes within teams and the handshakes with opposing teams:
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = \text{Total handshakes within teams} + \text{Total handshakes with opposing teams}
\]
\[
= 36 + 288 = 324
\]

### Step 6: Double-Check Calculations
- Handshakes within teams: \(3 \text{ teams} \times 12 = 36\)
- Handshakes with opposing teams: \(3 \text{ teams} \times 96 = 288\)
- Total: \(36 + 288 = 324\)

"The expression $2\cdot 3 \cdot 4\cdot 5+1$ is equal to 121, since multiplication is carried out before addition. However, we can obtain values other than 121 for this expression if we are allowed to change it by inserting parentheses. For example, we can obtain 144 by writing \[
(2\cdot (3\cdot 4)) \cdot (5+1) = 144.
\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).","To solve the problem, we need to explore how inserting parentheses in the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) can yield different results. The expression consists of four multiplication operations and one addition operation. 

### Step 1: Understand the Expression
The original expression is:
\[
2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1
\]
Calculating the multiplication first:
\[
2 \cdot 3 = 6
\]
\[
6 \cdot 4 = 24
\]
\[
24 \cdot 5 = 120
\]
Thus, the expression evaluates to:
\[
120 + 1 = 121
\]

### Step 2: Inserting Parentheses
We can insert parentheses in various ways to change the order of operations. The multiplication can be grouped in different ways, and we can also decide where to add \(1\).

### Step 3: Possible Groupings
The multiplication of four numbers can be grouped in several ways. The possible groupings for \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5\) are:

1. \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5)\)
2. \((2 \cdot 4) \cdot (3 \cdot 5)\)
3. \((2 \cdot 5) \cdot (3 \cdot 4)\)
4. \((3 \cdot 4) \cdot (2 \cdot 5)\)
5. \((3 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 4)\)
6. \((4 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 3)\)

Additionally, we can also consider adding \(1\) in different positions relative to the multiplication:

- After the entire multiplication
- After one of the grouped multiplications

### Step 4: Calculate Each Grouping
Let's calculate the results for each grouping:

1. **Grouping: \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5)\)**
   \[
   (6) \cdot (20) = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 120 + 1 = 121

2. **Grouping: \((2 \cdot 4) \cdot (3 \cdot 5)\)**
   \[
   (8) \cdot (15) = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

3. **Grouping: \((2 \cdot 5) \cdot (3 \cdot 4)\)**
   \[
   (10) \cdot (12) = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

4. **Grouping: \((3 \cdot 4) \cdot (2 \cdot 5)\)**
   \[
   (12) \cdot (10) = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

5. **Grouping: \((3 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 4)\)**
   \[
   (15) \cdot (8) = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

6. **Grouping: \((4 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 3)\)**
   \[
   (20) \cdot (6) = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

### Step 5: Other Parentheses Combinations
Now, let's consider adding \(1\) in different positions:

1. **Adding \(1\) to the first multiplication:**
   \[
   (2 + 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 100 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 100 + 1 = 101
   \]

2. **Adding \(1\) to the second multiplication:**
   \[
   2 \cdot (3 + 4) \cdot 5 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot 5 = 70 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 70 + 1 = 71
   \]

3. **Adding \(1\) to the third multiplication:**
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 + 5) = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 9 = 54 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 54 + 1 = 55
   \]

4. **Adding \(1\) after the last multiplication:**
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 = 144 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 144 + 1 = 145
   \]

### Step 6: Collecting Unique Results
From our calculations, we have the following unique results:
- \(121\)
- \(101\)
- \(71\)
- \(55\)
- \(145\)

### Final Count of Unique Values
Thus, the total number of unique values obtained by inserting parentheses in the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.
\end{align*}In total there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for the expression.",0,0.01746105
"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To solve the problem of how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we will break down the components and calculate the total combinations step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Components
The components of the Mr. Potato Head personality are:
- **Hairstyles**: 3 options (including the option to be bald)
- **Eyebrows**: 2 sets
- **Eyes**: 1 pair (only 1 option)
- **Ears**: 2 sets
- **Lips**: 2 sets
- **Shoes**: 2 options (regular shoes and clown shoes)

### Step 2: Determine the Options for Each Component
1. **Hairstyles**: 
   - 3 hairstyles + 1 option for being bald = 4 options
2. **Eyebrows**: 
   - 2 sets = 2 options
3. **Eyes**: 
   - 1 pair = 1 option
4. **Ears**: 
   - 2 sets = 2 options
5. **Lips**: 
   - 2 sets = 2 options
6. **Shoes**: 
   - 2 options = 2 options

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Combinations
To find the total number of different personalities, we multiply the number of options for each component together:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = (\text{Hairstyles}) \times (\text{Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Eyes}) \times (\text{Ears}) \times (\text{Lips}) \times (\text{Shoes})
\]

Substituting the values we found:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

### Step 4: Perform the Calculation
Now, we will calculate the total step by step:

1. Calculate \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. Calculate \(8 \times 1 = 8\)
3. Calculate \(8 \times 2 = 16\)
4. Calculate \(16 \times 2 = 32\)
5. Calculate \(32 \times 2 = 64\)

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities that Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head is:

\[
\boxed{64}
\]","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.00805425
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To find how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0, we can break down the problem as follows:

### Step 1: Define the Range
The numbers we are considering are three-digit numbers, specifically from 100 to 999.

### Step 2: Identify the Structure of the Numbers
A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
- \(a\) is the hundreds digit (1 to 9),
- \(b\) is the tens digit (0 to 9),
- \(c\) is the units digit (0 to 9).

### Step 3: Conditions for Exactly One 0
To have exactly one 0 in the number \(abc\), we can have the following cases:
1. \(b = 0\) and \(c \neq 0\)
2. \(c = 0\) and \(b \neq 0\)

### Step 4: Calculate Each Case

#### Case 1: \(b = 0\) and \(c \neq 0\)
- The number takes the form \(a0c\).
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since \(c\) cannot be 0, 9 options).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \text{ (choices for } a\text{)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for } c\text{)} = 81
\]

#### Case 2: \(c = 0\) and \(b \neq 0\)
- The number takes the form \(ab0\).
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(b\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since \(b\) cannot be 0, 9 options).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \text{ (choices for } a\text{)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for } b\text{)} = 81
\]

### Step 5: Combine the Results
Now, we add the results from both cases:
\[
81 \text{ (from case 1)} + 81 \text{ (from case 2)} = 162
\]

### Step 6: Final Answer
The total number of whole numbers between 99 and 999 that contain exactly one 0 is:
\[
\boxed{162}
\]","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.00941865
