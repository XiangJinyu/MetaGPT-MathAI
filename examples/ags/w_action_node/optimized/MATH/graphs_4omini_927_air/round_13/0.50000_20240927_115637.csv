"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Review the problem statement**: We have a convex pentagon with two congruent acute angles, and the other three angles are each equal to the sum of the two acute angles.

2. **Check for logical errors**: 
   - Let the measure of each acute angle be \( x \). Thus, the two acute angles contribute \( 2x \) to the total angle sum.
   - The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is \( 540^\circ \).
   - The three larger angles, each equal to \( 2x \), contribute \( 3(2x) = 6x \).

3. **Set up the equation**:
   \[
   2x + 6x = 540^\circ
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   8x = 540^\circ \implies x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
   \]

4. **Calculate the larger angles**:
   Each larger angle is:
   \[
   2x = 2(67.5^\circ) = 135^\circ
   \]

5. **Verify the solution**: 
   - The two acute angles are \( 67.5^\circ \) each.
   - The three larger angles are \( 135^\circ \) each.
   - Total angle sum: \( 2(67.5^\circ) + 3(135^\circ) = 135^\circ + 405^\circ = 540^\circ \), which is correct.

6. **Final answer**: The solution correctly identifies the measure of the larger angles.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.02133284999999999

label(""$n-1$"",(2.5,2.5));
[/asy]","Let's perform the error analysis and correction on the provided simplified solution.

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: We have a 3x3 magic square with specific values involving \( n \). The goal is to find the value of \( n \) such that the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals are equal.

2. **Check for Errors**: 
   - The values in the magic square are:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
     3 & 2n-9 & n \\
     n+1 & 1 & n-1
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - The sum of the first row is:
     \[
     (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 2n + 1
     \]
   - The sum of the second row is:
     \[
     3 + (2n-9) + n = 3n - 6
     \]
   - The sum of the third row is:
     \[
     (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = 2n + 1
     \]
   - Setting the sums of the first and second rows equal gives:
     \[
     2n + 1 = 3n - 6
     \]
     Solving this:
     \[
     1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies n = 7
     \]

3. **Verify All Aspects**: 
   - The sums of the columns and diagonals should also be checked:
     - First column: 
       \[
       (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
       \]
     - Second column:
       \[
       (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
       \]
     - Third column:
       \[
       2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
       \]
     - Main diagonal:
       \[
       (n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = 4n - 13
       \]
     - Other diagonal:
       \[
       2 + (2n-9) + (n+1) = 3n - 6
       \]

4. **Check for Consistency**: 
   - We need \( 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \) and \( 4n - 13 = 3n - 6 \).
   - From \( 4n - 13 = 3n - 6 \):
     \[
     n - 13 = -6 \implies n = 7
     \]

5. **Final Answer**: No errors were found in the calculations, and all conditions were satisfied. The final answer is confirmed.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","Let's perform the error analysis on the simplified solution.

1. **Review the problem statement**: We need to find out how many bad workers are required to complete the painting of the house in 3 hours, given that good workers can paint the house in 12 hours and bad workers in 36 hours.

2. **Check for logical errors and calculations**:
   - The rate of work for a good worker is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of the house per hour.
   - The rate of work for a bad worker is \( \frac{1}{36} \) of the house per hour.
   - If there are 3 good workers, their combined rate is:
     \[
     3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the house per hour.}
     \]
   - Let \( b \) be the number of bad workers. Their combined rate is:
     \[
     b \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{b}{36} \text{ of the house per hour.}
     \]
   - The total rate of work from both good and bad workers must equal the rate needed to complete the house in 3 hours, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the house per hour:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} + \frac{b}{36} = \frac{1}{3}.
     \]

3. **Solve the equation**:
   - To solve for \( b \), first find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 4, 36, and 3 is 36.
   - Rewrite the equation:
     \[
     \frac{9}{36} + \frac{b}{36} = \frac{12}{36}.
     \]
   - Combine the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{9 + b}{36} = \frac{12}{36}.
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 36:
     \[
     9 + b = 12.
     \]
   - Solve for \( b \):
     \[
     b = 12 - 9 = 3.
     \]

4. **Final answer**: The solution correctly identifies that 3 bad workers are needed to complete the painting in the required time.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\] 

No errors were found in the original solution.","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",1,0.02254109999999999
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","Let's perform the error analysis on the simplified solution.

1. **Review the problem statement**: We need to find a common English word whose product value equals 715, where the product value is determined by the letter values (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26).

2. **Check for logical errors and calculations**: 
   - The product value of the word ""JUMP"" is calculated as follows:
     - J = 10
     - U = 21
     - M = 13
     - P = 16
   - Therefore, the product value of ""JUMP"" is:
     \[
     10 \times 21 \times 13 \times 16
     \]
   - Calculating this step-by-step:
     - \(10 \times 21 = 210\)
     - \(210 \times 13 = 2730\)
     - \(2730 \times 16 = 43680\)
   - The product value of ""JUMP"" is 43680, not 715.

3. **Verify the solution**: Since ""JUMP"" does not yield a product value of 715, we need to find the correct word.

4. **Finding the correct word**: 
   - We need to factor 715:
     - The prime factorization of 715 is \(5 \times 11 \times 13\).
   - Corresponding letter values:
     - E = 5
     - K = 11
     - M = 13
   - The word ""EKM"" (not a common English word) does not work. However, ""ME"" (M=13, E=5) gives:

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have a square piece of paper with an area of \(49\) square inches. The side length of the square is \(\sqrt{49} = 7\) inches. When folded, two opposite corners coincide, forming two congruent triangles.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculations**: When the square is folded, the diagonal of the square becomes the base of the triangles. The length of the diagonal \(d\) of the square can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   d = s\sqrt{2} = 7\sqrt{2}
   \]
   where \(s\) is the side length of the square.

   The height of each triangle is half the side length of the square, which is:
   \[
   h = \frac{s}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
   \]

3. **Area of the Triangle**: The area \(A\) of one triangle can be calculated as:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 7\sqrt{2} \times \frac{7}{2} = \frac{49\sqrt{2}}{4}
   \]
   This confirms the triangles are congruent.

4. **Perimeter Calculation**: The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle consists of the two legs and the base. The legs are the sides of the square, which are both \(7\) inches, and the base is the diagonal \(7\sqrt{2}\). Thus, the perimeter is:
   \[
   P = 7 + 7 + 7\sqrt{2} = 14 + 7\sqrt{2}
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: The perimeter of one of the triangles is:
   \[
   \boxed{14 + 7\sqrt{2}}
   \]

In conclusion, the original simplified solution contained an error in the perimeter calculation. The corrected perimeter of one triangle is \(14 + 7\sqrt{2}\).","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.02327039999999999
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Problem Statement Review**: There are three teams of four players each. Each player shakes hands three times with every member of the opposing teams and once with each member of their own team.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculation Mistakes**:
   - Each team has 4 players, so there are \(3 \times 4 = 12\) players in total.
   - Each player shakes hands with 3 members of each of the 2 opposing teams (3 handshakes per opponent).
   - Each player also shakes hands once with each of the 3 members of their own team.

3. **Calculating Handshakes**:
   - Handshakes with opposing teams:
     - Each player shakes hands with \(4 \times 3 = 12\) players from the opposing teams (4 players from each of the 2 teams).
     - Since each handshake occurs 3 times, the total handshakes with opposing teams per player is \(12 \times 3 = 36\).
   - Handshakes with their own team:
     - Each player shakes hands with 3 members of their own team once, resulting in \(3\) handshakes.

   Therefore, the total handshakes per player is:
   \[
   36 + 3 = 39
   \]

   Since there are 12 players, the total number of handshakes is:
   \[
   12 \times 39 = 468
   \]

4. **Final Answer**: The previous answer of \(162\) is incorrect. The correct total number of handshakes is:

\[
\boxed{468}
\]","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

"The expression $2\cdot 3 \cdot 4\cdot 5+1$ is equal to 121, since multiplication is carried out before addition. However, we can obtain values other than 121 for this expression if we are allowed to change it by inserting parentheses. For example, we can obtain 144 by writing \[
(2\cdot (3\cdot 4)) \cdot (5+1) = 144.
\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).","Let's analyze the problem and the simplified solution step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: The expression given is \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\). We need to determine how many distinct values can be obtained by inserting parentheses into this expression.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculation Mistakes**: The original expression evaluates to \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\). The simplified solution states that only one value can be obtained, which is incorrect. 

3. **Verification of Solution**: We can insert parentheses in various ways to change the order of operations. For example:
   - \( (2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 6 \cdot 20 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121 \)
   - \( 2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) + 1 = 2 \cdot 60 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121 \)
   - \( (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 24 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121 \)
   - \( 2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 2 \cdot 60 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121 \)
   - \( (2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 6 \cdot 20 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121 \)
   - \( 2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 2 \cdot 60 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121 \)

   All these combinations yield the same result of 121.

4. **Final Count of Distinct Values**: Since all combinations yield the same result, the total number of distinct values obtained from the expression by inserting parentheses is indeed 1.

5. **Final Answer**: The simplified solution is correct in stating that only one distinct value can be obtained, which is 121. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}

"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Review the problem statement**: Tom has various components for Mr. Potato Head, and we need to calculate the total number of different combinations of these components, considering that he can choose to be bald (no hair).

2. **Components available**:
   - Hairstyles: 3 options (including bald)
   - Eyebrows: 2 sets
   - Eyes: 1 set
   - Ears: 2 sets
   - Lips: 2 sets
   - Shoes: 2 options (regular and clown)

3. **Logical structure**: 
   - For hairstyles, since he can choose to be bald, we have 3 hairstyles + 1 bald option = 4 choices.
   - For eyebrows, there are 2 choices.
   - For eyes, there is 1 choice.
   - For ears, there are 2 choices.
   - For lips, there are 2 choices.
   - For shoes, there are 2 choices.

4. **Calculation of combinations**:
   The total number of combinations can be calculated by multiplying the number of choices for each component:
   \[
   \text{Total combinations} = (\text{hairstyles}) \times (\text{eyebrows}) \times (\text{eyes}) \times (\text{ears}) \times (\text{lips}) \times (\text{shoes})
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total combinations} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
   \]

5. **Performing the calculation**:
   \[
   4 \times 2 = 8
   \]
   \[
   8 \times 1 = 8
   \]
   \[
   8 \times 2 = 16
   \]
   \[
   16 \times 2 = 32
   \]
   \[
   32 \times 2 = 64
   \]

6. **Final verification**: The calculation is correct, and all components have been accounted for. The answer is expressed in the correct form.

Since no errors were found in the simplified solution, the final answer remains:

\[
\boxed{64}
\]","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.02192309999999999
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"Let's analyze the problem of finding how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We need to find whole numbers in the range from 100 to 999 (since 99 is not included) that contain exactly one digit '0'.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculation Mistakes**: 
   - The numbers can be represented as three-digit numbers (from 100 to 999).
   - The digit '0' can only appear in the tens or units place, as having '0' in the hundreds place would not yield a three-digit number.

3. **Special Conditions**: 
   - If '0' is in the tens place, the number can be represented as \(1\text{0}x\) where \(x\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (to ensure it's a three-digit number). This gives us 9 possibilities: 100, 101, 102, ..., 109.
   - If '0' is in the units place, the number can be represented as \(1x\text{0}\) where \(x\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (to ensure it's a three-digit number). This gives us another 9 possibilities: 110, 120, 130, ..., 190.
   - The same logic applies for the hundreds digit being 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, leading to 9 possibilities for each case.

4. **Counting the Cases**:
   - For '0' in the tens place: 
     - Hundreds digit can be 1 to 9 (9 choices), and units digit can be 1 to 9 (9 choices).
     - Total: \(9\) (hundreds) \(\times 1\) (tens) \(\times 9\) (units) = 9.
   - For '0' in the units place:
     - Hundreds digit can be 1 to 9 (9 choices), and tens digit can be 1 to 9 (9 choices).
     - Total: \(9\) (hundreds) \(\times 9\) (tens) \(\times 1\) (units) = 9.

5. **Final Count**:
   - Total numbers with '0' in the tens place: \(9\)
   - Total numbers with '0' in the units place: \(9\)
