"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Review the problem statement**: We have a convex pentagon with two congruent acute angles, and the other three angles are each equal to the sum of the two acute angles.

2. **Check for logical errors**: 
   - Let the measure of each acute angle be \( x \). Thus, the two acute angles contribute \( 2x \) to the total angle sum.
   - The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is \( 540^\circ \).
   - The three larger angles, each equal to the sum of the two acute angles, would be \( 3(2x) = 6x \).

3. **Set up the equation**:
   \[
   2x + 6x = 540^\circ
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   8x = 540^\circ \implies x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
   \]

4. **Calculate the larger angles**: Each of the larger angles is:
   \[
   2x = 2(67.5^\circ) = 135^\circ
   \]

5. **Verify the solution**: 
   - The two acute angles are \( 67.5^\circ \) each.
   - The three larger angles are \( 135^\circ \) each.
   - Total angle sum: \( 2(67.5^\circ) + 3(135^\circ) = 135^\circ + 405^\circ = 540^\circ \), which is correct.

6. **Final answer**: No errors were found in the calculations or logic.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.018286949999999986

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: We have a magic square with specific values in each cell, and we need to find the value of \( n \) such that the sums of each row, column, and diagonal are equal.

2. **Check for Errors**: 
   - The values in the magic square are:

3. **Calculate Row Sums**:
   - First row: \( (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 2n + 1 \)
   - Second row: \( 3 + (2n-9) + n = 3n - 6 \)
   - Third row: \( (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = 2n + 1 \)

   Setting the first and second rows equal:
   \[
   2n + 1 = 3n - 6

     - Second column: \( (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6 \)
     - Third column: \( 2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1 \)

   All columns and rows yield consistent sums of \( 2n + 1 \) and \( 3n - 6 \).

5. **Final Answer**: Since all calculations confirm that \( n = 7 \) satisfies the conditions of the magic square, we conclude that the solution is correct.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","Let's perform the error analysis on the simplified solution.

1. **Review the problem statement**: We need to find out how many bad workers are required to complete the painting of the house in 3 hours, given that 3 good workers are available.

2. **Check for logical errors and calculations**:
   - Each good worker can paint the house in 12 hours, so their rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of the house per hour.
   - With 3 good workers, their combined rate is:
     \[
     3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the house per hour.}
     \]
   - Each bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours, so their rate is \( \frac{1}{36} \) of the house per hour.
   - Let \( b \) be the number of bad workers. Their combined rate is:
     \[
     b \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{b}{36} \text{ of the house per hour.}
     \]

3. **Total rate needed**: To finish painting the house in 3 hours, the total work done must equal 1 house:
   \[
   \text{Total rate} \times \text{Time} = 1 \implies \left(\frac{1}{4} + \frac{b}{36}\right) \times 3 = 1.
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} + \frac{3b}{36} = 1 \implies \frac{3}{4} + \frac{b}{12} = 1.
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   \frac{b}{12} = 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4}.
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by 12:
   \[
   b = 3.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We need to find a common English word whose product value equals 715, where the product value is calculated by multiplying the values assigned to each letter (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26).

2. **Simplified Solution Review**: The simplified solution states that there is ""None"" as the answer.

3. **Logical Errors and Calculation Mistakes**: 
   - We need to factor 715 to see if it can be represented as a product of letter values.
   - The prime factorization of 715 is \(5 \times 11 \times 13\).
   - The corresponding letter values are:
     - 5 = E
     - 11 = K
     - 13 = M
   - Therefore, the word ""EKM"" has a product value of \(5 \times 11 \times 13 = 715\).

4. **Addressing All Aspects**: The solution must consider that ""EKM"" is a valid combination of letters that yields the required product value.

5. **Final Answer**: Since we found a valid word, the previous conclusion of ""None"" is incorrect. The correct answer is ""EKM"".

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{EKM}}
\]","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have a square piece of paper with an area of \(49\) square inches. This means the side length of the square is \(7\) inches (since \(7^2 = 49\)). When folded, two opposite corners coincide, forming two congruent triangles.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculations**: When the square is folded, the diagonal of the square becomes the base of the triangles. The length of the diagonal \(d\) of a square with side length \(s\) is given by \(d = s\sqrt{2}\). For our square, \(d = 7\sqrt{2}\).

3. **Triangle Dimensions**: Each triangle has a base equal to half the diagonal of the square, which is \(\frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}\). The height of each triangle is the same as the side length of the square, which is \(7\) inches.

4. **Perimeter Calculation**: The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle can be calculated as follows:
   - Base: \(\frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}\)
   - Two equal sides (the lengths from the corners to the midpoint of the base): Each side can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. The length of each side is:
   \[
   \sqrt{\left(\frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 + 7^2} = \sqrt{\frac{49 \cdot 2}{4} + 49} = \sqrt{\frac{98}{4} + \frac{196}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{294}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{294}}{2} = \frac{7\sqrt{6}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the perimeter \(P\) is:
   \[
   P = \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2} + 2 \cdot \frac{7\sqrt{6}}{2} = \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{14\sqrt{6}}{2} = \frac{7\sqrt{2} + 14\sqrt{6}}{2}
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: The simplified solution provided was incorrect. The correct perimeter of one of the triangles is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{7\sqrt{2} + 14\sqrt{6}}{2}}
\]","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.02262944999999999
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: There are three teams of four players each. Each player shakes hands three times with every member of the opposing teams and once with each member of their own team.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculation Mistakes**:
   - Each team has 4 players, so there are \(3 \times 4 = 12\) players in total.
   - Each player shakes hands with:
     - **Own Team**: 3 handshakes (since they shake hands once with each of the 3 other members of their own team).
     - **Opposing Teams**: Each player shakes hands with 4 players from each of the 2 opposing teams, totaling \(4 \times 2 = 8\) players. Since they shake hands 3 times with each of these 8 players, that results in \(8 \times 3 = 24\) handshakes.

3. **Total Handshakes per Player**:
   - Total handshakes per player = Handshakes with own team + Handshakes with opposing teams = \(3 + 24 = 27\).

4. **Total Handshakes for All Players**:
   - Since there are 12 players, the total number of handshakes is \(12 \times 27 = 324\).

5. **Correction**: The original simplified solution of \(162\) is incorrect. The correct total number of handshakes is \(324\).

Final answer:
\(\boxed{324}\)","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: The expression given is \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\). We need to determine how many distinct values can be obtained by inserting parentheses into this expression.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculation Mistakes**: The original expression evaluates to \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\). The simplified solution states that only one value can be obtained, which is incorrect. 

3. **Verification of Solution**: We can insert parentheses in various ways to change the order of operations. For example:
   - \( (2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 6 \cdot 20 + 1 = 121 \)
   - \( 2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) + 1 = 2 \cdot 60 + 1 = 121 \)
   - \( (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 24 \cdot 5 + 1 = 121 \)
   - \( 2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 2 \cdot 60 + 1 = 121 \)
   - \( (2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 6 \cdot 20 + 1 = 121 \)
   - \( 2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 2 \cdot 60 + 1 = 121 \)

   All these combinations yield the same result of 121.

4. **Final Answer Form**: Since all combinations yield the same value, the total number of distinct values obtained is indeed 1.

5. **Conclusion**: The simplified solution is correct in stating that only one value can be obtained, but it should clarify that this is the only value regardless of how parentheses are inserted.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}

1. **Review the problem statement**: Tom has various components for Mr. Potato Head, and we need to calculate the total number of different combinations of these components, considering that he can choose to be bald (no hair).

2. **Components available**:
   - Hairstyles: 3 options (including bald)
   - Eyebrows: 2 sets
   - Eyes: 1 set
   - Ears: 2 sets
   - Lips: 2 sets
   - Shoes: 2 options (regular and clown)

3. **Logical structure**: 
   - For hairstyles, since he can be bald, we have 3 hairstyles + 1 bald option = 4 choices.
   - For eyebrows, there are 2 choices.
   - For eyes, there is 1 choice.
   - For ears, there are 2 choices.
   - For lips, there are 2 choices.
   - For shoes, there are 2 choices.

4. **Calculation of combinations**:
   The total number of combinations can be calculated by multiplying the number of choices for each component:

How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"Let's analyze the problem of finding how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We need to find whole numbers in the range from 100 to 999 (since 99 is not included) that contain exactly one digit '0'.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculation Mistakes**: 
   - The numbers can be represented as three-digit numbers (from 100 to 999).
   - The digit '0' can only appear in the second or third position (i.e., in the tens or units place) since the first digit (hundreds place) cannot be '0'.

3. **Cases to Consider**:
   - **Case 1**: The number is of the form \(A0B\) where \(A\) is the hundreds digit (1-9) and \(B\) is the units digit (1-9).
     - Choices for \(A\): 9 (1-9)
     - Choices for \(B\): 9 (1-9)
