"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","Let's analyze the problem and the simplified solution step by step.

1. **Review the problem statement**: We have a convex pentagon with two congruent acute angles, and the other three angles are each equal to the sum of the two acute angles.

2. **Check for logical errors**: 
   - Let the measure of each acute angle be \( x \). Thus, the two acute angles contribute \( 2x \) to the total angle sum.
   - The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is \( 540^\circ \).
   - The three larger angles, each equal to the sum of the two acute angles, would be \( 3(2x) = 6x \).

3. **Set up the equation**:
   \[
   2x + 6x = 540^\circ
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   8x = 540^\circ \implies x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
   \]

4. **Calculate the larger angles**: Each of the larger angles is:
   \[
   2x = 2(67.5^\circ) = 135^\circ
   \]

5. **Verify the solution**: 
   - The two acute angles are \( 67.5^\circ \) each.
   - The three larger angles are \( 135^\circ \) each.
   - The total angle sum is:
   \[
   2(67.5^\circ) + 3(135^\circ) = 135^\circ + 405^\circ = 540^\circ
   \]
   This confirms the calculations are correct.

6. **Final answer**: The common measure of the large angles is indeed \( 135^\circ \).

Thus, the final answer is \( \boxed{135} \).","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.021049349999999998

[/asy]","Let's perform the error analysis and correction on the provided simplified solution.

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: We have a 3x3 magic square with specific values expressed in terms of \( n \). The goal is to find the value of \( n \) such that the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals are equal.

2. **Check for Errors**: 
   - The values in the magic square are:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
     3 & 2n-9 & n \\
     n+1 & 1 & n-1
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - The sum of the first row is:
     \[
     (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 2n + 1
     \]
   - The sum of the second row is:
     \[
     3 + (2n-9) + n = 3n - 6
     \]
   - The sum of the third row is:
     \[
     (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = 2n + 1
     \]
   - Setting the sums of the first and second rows equal gives:
     \[
     2n + 1 = 3n - 6
     \]
     Solving this:
     \[
     1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies n = 7
     \]

3. **Verify All Aspects**: 
   - The sums of the columns and diagonals must also be checked:
     - First column: 
       \[
       (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
       \]
     - Second column:
       \[
       (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
       \]
     - Third column:
       \[
       2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
       \]
     - Main diagonal:
       \[
       (n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = 4n - 13
       \]
     - Other diagonal:
       \[
       2 + (2n-9) + (n+1) = 3n - 6
       \]

4. **Check for Consistency**: 
   - We have \( 2n + 1 \) and \( 3n - 6 \) from the rows and columns. Setting \( 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \) gives \( n = 7 \).
   - The diagonal sums must also equal \( 2n + 1 \) or \( 3n - 6 \). For \( n = 7 \):
     - \( 4n - 13 = 4(7) - 13 = 28 - 13 = 15 \)
     - \( 2n + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15 \)
     - \( 3n - 6 = 3(7) - 6 = 21 - 6 = 15 \)

5. **Final Answer**: All checks confirm that \( n = 7 \) satisfies the conditions of the magic square.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","Let's perform the error analysis on the simplified solution.

1. **Review the problem statement**: We need to find out how many bad workers are required to complete the painting of the house in 3 hours, given that 3 good workers are available.

2. **Check for logical errors and calculations**:
   - Each good worker can paint the house in 12 hours, so their rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of the house per hour.
   - With 3 good workers, their combined rate is:
     \[
     3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the house per hour.}
     \]
   - Each bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours, so their rate is \( \frac{1}{36} \) of the house per hour.
   - Let \( b \) be the number of bad workers. Their combined rate is:
     \[
     b \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{b}{36} \text{ of the house per hour.}
     \]

3. **Set up the equation for the total work done in 3 hours**:
   - The total work done in 3 hours must equal 1 house:
     \[
     3 \left( \frac{1}{4} + \frac{b}{36} \right) = 1.
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} + \frac{3b}{36} = 1,
     \]
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} + \frac{b}{12} = 1.
     \]
   - Subtract \( \frac{3}{4} \) from both sides:
     \[
     \frac{b}{12} = 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4}.
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 12:
     \[
     b = 3.
     \]

4. **Verify the solution**: The calculations confirm that 3 bad workers are indeed required to meet the deadline.

5. **Final answer**: No errors were found in the calculations or logic. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.

Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.

What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","Let's analyze the problem and the simplified solution step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We need to find a common English word whose product value equals 715, where the product value is calculated by multiplying the values assigned to each letter (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26).

2. **Simplified Solution Review**: The simplified solution states that there is ""None"" as the answer.

3. **Logical Errors and Calculation Mistakes**: 
   - We need to factor 715 to see if it can be represented as a product of letter values.
   - The prime factorization of 715 is \(5 \times 11 \times 13\).
   - The corresponding letter values are:
     - 5 = E
     - 11 = K
     - 13 = M
   - Therefore, the word ""EKM"" has a product value of \(5 \times 11 \times 13 = 715\).

4. **Addressing All Aspects**: The solution must consider that ""EKM"" is a valid combination of letters that yields the required product value.

5. **Final Answer**: Since we found a valid word combination, the previous conclusion of ""None"" is incorrect.

The corrected solution is:
\[
\boxed{\text{EKM}}
\]","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have a square piece of paper with an area of \(49\) square inches. This means the side length of the square is \(7\) inches (since \(7^2 = 49\)). When folded, two opposite corners coincide, forming two congruent triangles.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculations**: When the square is folded, the diagonal of the square becomes the base of the triangles. The length of the diagonal \(d\) of the square can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   d = s\sqrt{2} = 7\sqrt{2}
   \]
   The height of each triangle is half the side length of the square, which is \(3.5\) inches.

3. **Triangle Dimensions**: Each triangle has a base of \(7\sqrt{2}\) inches and a height of \(3.5\) inches. The two legs of the triangle are the sides of the square, which are both \(7\) inches.

4. **Perimeter Calculation**: The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle can be calculated as:
   \[
   P = \text{base} + 2 \times \text{leg} = 7\sqrt{2} + 7 + 7 = 7\sqrt{2} + 14

5. **Final Answer**: The perimeter of one of the triangles is expressed in simplest radical form as:
   \[
   \boxed{7\sqrt{2} + 14}

In conclusion, the corrected perimeter of one of the triangles is \(7\sqrt{2} + 14\) inches.","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.0233832
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: There are three teams of four players each. Each player shakes hands three times with every member of the opposing teams and once with each member of their own team.

2. **Logical Errors and Calculation Mistakes**:
   - Each team has 4 players, so there are a total of \(3 \times 4 = 12\) players.
   - Each player shakes hands with:
     - 4 players from their own team (1 handshake each) = 4 handshakes.
     - 8 players from the other two teams (3 handshakes each) = \(8 \times 3 = 24\) handshakes.
   - Therefore, each player participates in \(4 + 24 = 28\) handshakes.

3. **Total Handshakes Calculation**:
   - Since there are 12 players, the total number of handshakes is:
   \[
   12 \times 28 = 336
   \]
   - However, this counts each handshake twice (once for each participant), so we need to divide by 2:
   \[
   \frac{336}{2} = 168
   \]

4. **Final Answer**: The total number of handshakes is \(168\).

Thus, the corrected final answer is:
\[
\boxed{168}
\]","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

   - Eyebrows: 2 sets
   - Eyes: 1 pair
   - Ears: 2 sets
   - Lips: 2 sets
   - Shoes: 2 options (regular and clown)

3. **Logical breakdown**:
   - For hairstyles, since Mr. Potato Head can be bald, we have 3 hairstyles + 1 bald option = 4 options.
   - For eyebrows, there are 2 options.
   - For eyes, there is 1 option.
   - For ears, there are 2 options.
   - For lips, there are 2 options.
   - For shoes, there are 2 options.

4. **Calculating total combinations**:
   The total number of combinations can be calculated by multiplying the number of options for each component:
   \[
   \text{Total combinations} = (\text{hairstyles}) \times (\text{eyebrows}) \times (\text{eyes}) \times (\text{ears}) \times (\text{lips}) \times (\text{shoes})
