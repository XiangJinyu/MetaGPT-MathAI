"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We have a convex pentagon with:
- Two congruent acute angles (let's denote each of these angles as \( x \)).
- Three other angles, each equal to the sum of the two acute angles.

### Step 2: Break Down the Problem
1. The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, \( n = 5 \):
   \[
   \text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
   \]

2. We have two acute angles \( x \) and three angles that are each equal to \( 2x \) (since each of the three angles is equal to the sum of the two acute angles).

### Step 3: Set Up the Equation
The total sum of the angles in the pentagon can be expressed as:
\[
x + x + 2x + 2x + 2x = 540^\circ
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
6x = 540^\circ
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
Now, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{540^\circ}{6} = 90^\circ
\]

### Step 5: Determine the Large Angles
Since \( x = 90^\circ \) is not an acute angle, we need to reconsider our interpretation. The acute angles must be less than \( 90^\circ \). Let's denote the acute angles as \( x \) and the large angles as \( y \). The relationship we established earlier still holds:
\[
x + x + y + y + y = 540^\circ
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
2x + 3y = 540^\circ
\]

### Step 6: Use the Relationship Between Angles
From the problem, we know:
\[
y = 2x
\]
Substituting \( y \) into the equation gives:
\[
2x + 3(2x) = 540^\circ
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 6x = 540^\circ
\]
\[
8x = 540^\circ
\]
\[
x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
\]

### Step 7: Find the Measure of the Large Angles
Now substituting back to find \( y \):
\[
y = 2x = 2(67.5^\circ) = 135^\circ
\]

### Final Answer
The common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is:
\[
\boxed{135^\circ}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",0,0.013494450000000002

label(""$2$"",(2.5,.5));
label(""$n$"",(2.5,1.5));
label(""$n-1$"",(2.5,2.5));
[/asy]","To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \( n \) in the given magic square. A magic square is defined such that the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are equal.

Let's denote the magic constant (the common sum) as \( S \).

The magic square is structured as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the sum of the first row

The first row is:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the sum of the second row

The second row is:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the sum of the third row

The third row is:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 4: Set the sums of the rows equal to each other

Since the sums of the first and third rows are equal, we can set them equal to the sum of the second row:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( n \)

Rearranging the equation:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \implies 1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n
\]

### Step 6: Verify the value of \( n \)

Now, let's substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check if all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to the same value.

Substituting \( n = 7 \):
- First row: \( 7 - 3 = 4 \), \( 7 + 2 = 9 \), \( 2 \)
  \[
  4 + 9 + 2 = 15
  \]
  
- Second row: \( 3 \), \( 2(7) - 9 = 14 - 9 = 5 \), \( 7 \)
  \[
  3 + 5 + 7 = 15
  \]

- Third row: \( 7 + 1 = 8 \), \( 1 \), \( 7 - 1 = 6 \)
  \[
  8 + 1 + 6 = 15
  \]

### Step 7: Check the columns

- First column: \( 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \)
- Second column: \( 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \)
- Third column: \( 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \)

### Step 8: Check the diagonals

- Main diagonal: \( 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)
- Other diagonal: \( 2 + 5 + 8 = 15 \)

Since all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to \( 15 \), our solution is verified.

### Final Answer

The value of \( n \) is \( \boxed{7} \).","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem, we need to determine how many bad workers are required to help the 3 good workers paint the house in 3 hours.

### Step 1: Determine the work rates of the workers.

1. **Good Worker Rate**:
   - A good worker can paint the house in 12 hours.
   - Therefore, the rate of one good worker is:
     \[
     \text{Rate of one good worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

2. **Bad Worker Rate**:
   - A bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours.
   - Therefore, the rate of one bad worker is:
     \[
     \text{Rate of one bad worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the combined work rate of the good workers.

- If there are 3 good workers, their combined rate is:
  \[
  \text{Combined rate of 3 good workers} = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses per hour}
  \]

### Step 3: Determine the total work needed to paint the house in 3 hours.

- To paint the entire house in 3 hours, the total work rate needed is:
  \[
  \text{Total work rate needed} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{3 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ houses per hour}
  \]

### Step 4: Set up the equation for the total work rate.

Let \( x \) be the number of bad workers. The combined rate of \( x \) bad workers is:
\[
\text{Combined rate of } x \text{ bad workers} = x \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{x}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
\]

### Step 5: Combine the rates and set up the equation.

The total work rate from both good and bad workers must equal the required work rate:
\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{x}{36} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

### Step 6: Solve for \( x \).

1. To eliminate the fractions, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4, 36, and 3 is 36. Multiply the entire equation by 36:
   \[
   36 \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) + 36 \left(\frac{x}{36}\right) = 36 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   9 + x = 12
   \]

2. Now, solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 12 - 9 = 3
   \]

### Step 7: Conclusion

You need **3 bad workers** in addition to the 3 good workers to paint the house in 3 hours.

### Final Answer:
**3 bad workers** are required.","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",0,0.0143484
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To find a common English word with a product value of 715, we first need to factor 715 into its prime factors and then relate those factors to the letter values (A = 1, B = 2, ..., Z = 26).

### Step 1: Factor 715
We start by finding the prime factorization of 715.

1. Check divisibility by 5 (the last digit is 5):
   \[
   715 \div 5 = 143
   \]
   So, we have:
   \[
   715 = 5 \times 143
   \]

2. Next, we factor 143. Check divisibility by 11 (since \(1 - 4 + 3 = 0\), which is divisible by 11):
   \[
   143 \div 11 = 13
   \]
   Thus, we have:
   \[
   143 = 11 \times 13
   \]

Combining these, we get the complete factorization:
\[
715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
\]

### Step 2: Relate Factors to Letter Values
Now we need to find letters corresponding to these factors:
- 5 corresponds to E (5th letter)
- 11 corresponds to K (11th letter)
- 13 corresponds to M (13th letter)

### Step 3: Form Possible Words
We can form words using the letters E, K, and M. The letters can be arranged in different combinations. 

### Step 4: Check Common English Words
The letters E, K, and M can be arranged to form the word ""MEK"" or ""KEM"", but these are not common English words. 

However, if we consider the letters in different arrangements, we can also check for other combinations. 

### Step 5: Check for Other Combinations
We can also consider the possibility of using the letter values in different combinations. 

After checking various combinations, we find that the word ""ME"" (which has a product value of \(13 \times 5 = 65\)) does not work, and ""KE"" (which has a product value of \(11 \times 5 = 55\)) also does not work.

### Final Check
After checking various combinations and arrangements, we find that the word ""KEM"" is not a common English word. 

However, if we consider the letters E, K, and M, we can also check for the word ""MEEK"" which has a product value of \(13 \times 5 \times 5 \times 11 = 715\).

### Final Answer
The common English word with a product value of 715 is **""MEEK""**.","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}
(5)\cdot (11) \cdot (13) &= 5\cdot 11\cdot 13 \\
(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.",0,0.010555950000000003
Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"To estimate \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number to estimate**: The number we are squaring is \( 14.7923412 \).

2. **Round the number**: Since we want to estimate, we can round \( 14.7923412 \) to a simpler number. The nearest whole number is \( 15 \).

3. **Square the rounded number**: Now we will calculate \( 15^2 \):
   \[
   15^2 = 15 \times 15 = 225
   \]

4. **Estimate to the nearest hundred**: The result \( 225 \) is already in the range of hundreds. To round \( 225 \) to the nearest hundred, we look at the tens digit (which is \( 2 \)). Since \( 2 < 5 \), we round down to \( 200 \).

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given information and breaking it down step-by-step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We have a square piece of paper with an area of \(49\) square inches. When folded, one pair of opposite corners coincide, creating two congruent triangles upon unfolding.

2. **Finding the Side Length of the Square**: 
   The area of the square is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = s^2
   \]
   where \(s\) is the side length of the square. Given that the area is \(49\) square inches, we can find \(s\):
   \[
   s^2 = 49 \implies s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Visualizing the Fold**: When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, we can visualize the square as having corners at points \(A(0, 0)\), \(B(7, 0)\), \(C(7, 7)\), and \(D(0, 7)\). If we fold the square such that corner \(A\) coincides with corner \(C\), the fold line will be the diagonal \(AC\).

4. **Finding the Length of the Diagonal**: The diagonal \(AC\) can be calculated using the distance formula:
   \[
   AC = \sqrt{(7 - 0)^2 + (7 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{7^2 + 7^2} = \sqrt{49 + 49} = \sqrt{98} = 7\sqrt{2}
   \]

5. **Identifying the Triangles**: The fold creates two congruent right triangles. Each triangle has:
   - One leg equal to the side of the square, which is \(7\) inches.
   - The other leg is also equal to the side of the square, which is \(7\) inches.
   - The hypotenuse is the diagonal \(AC\), which we calculated as \(7\sqrt{2}\).

6. **Calculating the Perimeter of One Triangle**: The perimeter \(P\) of one of the triangles can be calculated as:
   \[
   P = \text{leg}_1 + \text{leg}_2 + \text{hypotenuse} = 7 + 7 + 7\sqrt{2}
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   P = 14 + 7\sqrt{2}
   \]

7. **Final Answer**: The perimeter of one of the triangles is:
   \[
   \boxed{14 + 7\sqrt{2}} \text{ inches}
   \]","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.015175650000000002
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of how many handshakes occur at the national curling championships, we can break it down into manageable parts.

### Step 1: Understand the Teams and Players
There are three teams, and each team has four players. Therefore, the total number of players is:
\[
3 \text{ teams} \times 4 \text{ players/team} = 12 \text{ players}
\]

### Step 2: Handshakes Within Teams
Each player shakes hands once with each member of their own team. Since there are 4 players on each team, the number of handshakes within one team can be calculated using the combination formula for choosing 2 players from 4:
\[
\text{Handshakes within one team} = \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
\]
Since there are 3 teams, the total number of handshakes within all teams is:
\[
\text{Total handshakes within teams} = 3 \text{ teams} \times 6 \text{ handshakes/team} = 18
\]

### Step 3: Handshakes Between Teams
Each player shakes hands three times with every member of the opposing teams. Since there are 2 opposing teams for each player, we can calculate the number of handshakes between teams as follows:

- Each player shakes hands with 4 players from each of the 2 opposing teams:
\[
\text{Handshakes per player with opposing teams} = 4 \text{ players/team} \times 2 \text{ teams} = 8 \text{ players}
\]
- Since each player shakes hands 3 times with each of these 8 players:
\[
\text{Total handshakes per player with opposing teams} = 8 \text{ players} \times 3 \text{ handshakes/player} = 24
\]
- With 12 players in total, the total number of handshakes between teams is:
\[
\text{Total handshakes between teams} = 12 \text{ players} \times 24 \text{ handshakes/player} = 288
\]

### Step 4: Combine the Handshakes
Now, we can combine the handshakes from within the teams and between the teams:
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = \text{Total handshakes within teams} + \text{Total handshakes between teams}
\]
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = 18 + 288 = 306
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of handshakes that occur at the national curling championships is:
\[
\boxed{306}
\]","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

There are 12 players in total, which offers $12\times27=324$ handshakes, but since a handshake takes place between two people, we've counted every handshake twice.

The final answer is $\dfrac{324}{2}=\boxed{162}$ handshakes.",0,0.010875750000000003
"The expression $2\cdot 3 \cdot 4\cdot 5+1$ is equal to 121, since multiplication is carried out before addition. However, we can obtain values other than 121 for this expression if we are allowed to change it by inserting parentheses. For example, we can obtain 144 by writing \[
(2\cdot (3\cdot 4)) \cdot (5+1) = 144.
\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).","To solve the problem, we need to explore how inserting parentheses in the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) can yield different results. The key is to understand how the placement of parentheses affects the order of operations.

### Step 1: Understand the Expression
The original expression is:
\[
2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1
\]
Calculating the multiplication first:
\[
2 \cdot 3 = 6
\]
\[

### Step 2: Inserting Parentheses
We can insert parentheses in various ways to change the order of operations. The multiplication can be grouped in different ways, and we can also group the addition with the multiplication.

### Step 3: Possible Groupings
We will consider all possible ways to insert parentheses in the multiplication part \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5\) and then add 1.

1. **Single Grouping of Two Factors**:
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 24 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 20 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)

2. **Grouping Three Factors**:
   - \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 24 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 2 \cdot 60 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)

3. **Grouping with Addition**:
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 6 \cdot 20 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) + 5 + 1 = 24 + 5 + 1 = 30\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3) + (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 6 + 20 + 1 = 27\)
   - \(2 + (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 2 + 60 + 1 = 63\)
   - \(2 + (3 \cdot 4) + (5 + 1) = 2 + 12 + 6 = 20\)

4. **Other Combinations**:
   - \((2 \cdot 3) + (4 \cdot 5 + 1) = 6 + 21 = 27\)
   - \((2 + 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 5 \cdot 20 + 1 = 100 + 1 = 101\)
   - \((2 + 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = (2 + 12) \cdot 5 + 1 = 14 \cdot 5 + 1 = 70 + 1 = 71\)

From the calculations above, we can summarize the unique results obtained:
- 121
- 144
- 30
- 27
- 63
- 20
- 101
- 71

### Step 5: Count Unique Values
Now, we will count the unique values obtained:
- 121
- 144
- 30
- 27
- 63
- 20
- 101

### Final Answer
The total number of unique values that can be obtained by inserting parentheses in the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) is:

\boxed{8}
\]","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.
\end{align*}In total there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for the expression.",0,0.016497150000000002
"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To determine how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we need to consider each component of the personality and how many choices he has for each.

### Step 1: Identify the components and their choices

1. **Hairstyles**: 3 options (including the option to be bald)
2. **Eyebrows**: 2 options
3. **Eyes**: 1 option (googly eyes)
4. **Ears**: 2 options
5. **Lips**: 2 options
6. **Shoes**: 2 options (regular shoes and clown shoes)

### Step 2: Calculate the total combinations

Since Tom can choose one option from each category, we can multiply the number of choices for each component together. However, we need to account for the fact that he can choose to be bald, which adds an additional option to the hairstyles.

#### Hairstyle Choices:
- 3 hairstyles + 1 bald option = 4 options

Now, we can list the choices for each component:
- **Hairstyles**: 4 options (3 hairstyles + bald)
- **Eyebrows**: 2 options
- **Eyes**: 1 option
- **Ears**: 2 options
- **Lips**: 2 options
- **Shoes**: 2 options

### Step 3: Multiply the choices

Now we multiply the number of choices for each component:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = (\text{Hairstyles}) \times (\text{Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Eyes}) \times (\text{Ears}) \times (\text{Lips}) \times (\text{Shoes})
\]

Substituting in the values:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

### Step 4: Perform the calculations

Calculating step-by-step:

1. \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \)
2. \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \)
3. \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \)
4. \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \)
5. \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \)

### Final Answer

Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities Tom can come up with is:

\[
\boxed{64}
\]","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.010239000000000003
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To find how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0, we can break down the problem into manageable parts. 

### Step 1: Define the range
The numbers we are considering are three-digit numbers, specifically from 100 to 999. 

### Step 2: Identify the structure of the numbers
A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
- \(a\) is the hundreds digit (1 to 9),
- \(b\) is the tens digit (0 to 9),
- \(c\) is the units digit (0 to 9).

### Step 3: Conditions for exactly one 0
We need to find cases where there is exactly one 0 in the number \(abc\). This can happen in two scenarios:
1. The 0 is in the tens place (\(a0c\)).
2. The 0 is in the units place (\(ab0\)).

### Case 1: 0 in the tens place (\(a0c\))
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be 0 to ensure there's only one 0) (9 options).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \text{ (choices for } a\text{)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for } c\text{)} = 81.
\]

### Case 2: 0 in the units place (\(ab0\))
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(b\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be 0 to ensure there's only one 0) (9 options).

Thus, the total for this case is:
\[
9 \text{ (choices for } a\text{)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for } b\text{)} = 81.
\]

### Step 4: Combine the results
Now, we add the results from both cases:
\[
81 \text{ (from case 1)} + 81 \text{ (from case 2)} = 162.
\]

### Step 5: Final answer
The total number of whole numbers between 99 and 999 that contain exactly one 0 is:
\[
\boxed{162}.
\]","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.008794800000000002
