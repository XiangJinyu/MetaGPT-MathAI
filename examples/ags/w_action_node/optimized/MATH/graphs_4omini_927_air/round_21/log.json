While the calculations regarding the prime factorization and the mapping of letters to their corresponding values are correct, the word \"EKM\" is not a common English word. \n\nLet's go through the solution step-by-step to find a valid common English word with a product value of 715.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nEach letter corresponds to a numerical value: A = 1, B = 2, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is calculated by multiplying the values of its letters.\n\n### Step 2: Prime Factorization of 715\nThe prime factorization of 715 is:\n\\[\n715 = 5 \\times 11 \\times 13\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Mapping Prime Factors to Letters\n- 5 corresponds to E (5th letter)\n- 11 corresponds to K (11th letter)\n- 13 corresponds to M (13th letter)\n\n### Step 4: Forming the Word\nThe letters derived from the prime factors are E, K, and M. However, we need to check if there are any common English words that can be formed using these letters or their combinations.\n\n### Step 5: Exploring Combinations\nWe can also consider combinations of letters that yield the same product value. \n\n1. **Using E (5)**:\n   - If we include E, we can try combinations with other letters.\n   \n2. **Using K (11)**:\n   - If we include K, we can try combinations with other letters.\n\n3. **Using M (13)**:\n   - If we include M, we can try combinations with other letters.\n\n### Finding a Valid Word\nAfter exploring various combinations, we find that the word \"ME\" (M = 13, E = 5) gives:\n\\[\n\\text{Product value of ME} = 13 \\times 5 = 65 \\quad \\text{(not valid)}\n\\]\n\nHowever, if we consider the word \"KEG\":\n- K = 11\n- E = 5\n- G = 7\n\nCalculating the product:\n\\[\n\\text{Product value of KEG} = 11 \\times 5 \\times 7 = 385 \\quad \\text{(not valid)}\n\\]\n\nAfter further exploration, we find that the word \"MIX\" (M = 13, I = 9, X = 24) gives:\n\\[\n\\text{Product value of MIX} = 13 \\times 9 \\times 24 = 2808 \\quad \\text{(not valid)}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter checking various combinations, it appears that there is no common English word that has a product value of 715 based on the letters derived from the prime factorization. \n\nThus, the final answer is that there is no common English word with a product value of 715. \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{No common English word found}}\n\\]",
