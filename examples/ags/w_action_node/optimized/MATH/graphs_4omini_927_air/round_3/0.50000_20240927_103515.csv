"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem of finding the common measure of the large angles in a convex pentagon with specific angle properties, we will follow a structured approach. 

### Step 1: Define the Angles
Letâ€™s denote the two congruent acute angles as \( x \). Since they are acute, we know:
\[
0 < x < 90
\]

According to the problem, the measure of each of the other three interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. Therefore, we can denote the measures of the three other angles as \( y \):
\[
y = x + x = 2x
\]

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation for the Sum of Angles
The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
\]
For a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)):
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
\]

### Step 3: Write the Equation for the Sum of the Angles
Now we can express the total sum of the angles in our pentagon:
\[
2x + 3(2x) = 540^\circ
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 6x = 540^\circ
\]
Combining like terms gives:
\[
8x = 540^\circ
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
Now, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \( y \)
Next, we find \( y \):
\[
y = 2x = 2 \times 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ
\]

### Step 6: Verify the Angles
Now we have the measures of the angles in the pentagon:
- Two angles of \( 67.5^\circ \)
- Three angles of \( 135^\circ \)

### Step 7: Check Validity for a Convex Pentagon
To ensure that all angles are valid for a convex pentagon:
- \( 67.5^\circ \) is acute (valid)
- \( 135^\circ \) is obtuse but less than \( 180^\circ \) (valid)

### Conclusion
All angles meet the criteria for a convex pentagon. Therefore, the common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.018978749999999992

label(""$n$"",(2.5,1.5));
label(""$n-1$"",(2.5,2.5));
[/asy]","To solve for \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sums of each row, column, and diagonal are equal. Let's denote the magic constant (the common sum) as \( S \).

The magic square is structured as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the sum of the first row

The first row is:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the sum of the second row

The second row is:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the sum of the third row

The third row is:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 4: Set the sums of the rows equal to each other

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we can set the first and second rows equal to each other:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( n \)

Rearranging the equation:
\[
2n + 1 + 6 = 3n
\]
\[
7 = 3n - 2n
\]
\[
n = 7
\]

### Step 6: Verify the value of \( n \)

Now, we will substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check if all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to the same value.

Substituting \( n = 7 \):
- First row: 
\[
7 - 3 = 4, \quad 7 + 2 = 9, \quad 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]
- Second row:
\[
3, \quad 2(7) - 9 = 14 - 9 = 5, \quad 7 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]
- Third row:
\[
7 + 1 = 8, \quad 1, \quad 7 - 1 = 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]

### Step 7: Check the columns

- First column:
\[
4 + 3 + 8 = 15
\]
- Second column:
\[
9 + 5 + 1 = 15
\]
- Third column:
\[
2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]

### Step 8: Check the diagonals

- Main diagonal:
\[
4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]
- Other diagonal:
\[
2 + 5 + 8 = 15
\]

Since all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to \( 15 \), we confirm that our value for \( n \) is correct.

Thus, the value of \( n \) is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem of how many bad workers are needed alongside the 3 good workers to paint the house in 3 hours, we will follow a detailed step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Determine the Work Rates of Good and Bad Workers

1. **Good Worker:**
   - A good worker can paint the house in 12 hours.
   - Therefore, the work rate of one good worker is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of one good worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

2. **Bad Worker:**
   - A bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours.
   - Therefore, the work rate of one bad worker is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of one bad worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Work Rate of the Good Workers

Since we have 3 good workers, their combined work rate is:
\[
\text{Total work rate of 3 good workers} = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses per hour}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the Required Work Rate to Paint the House in 3 Hours

To paint 1 house in 3 hours, the required total work rate is:
\[
\text{Required work rate} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{3 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ houses per hour}
\]

### Step 4: Set Up the Equation for Total Work Rate

Let \( x \) be the number of bad workers. The total work rate of \( x \) bad workers is:
\[
\text{Total work rate of } x \text{ bad workers} = x \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{x}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
\]

Now, we can set up the equation for the total work rate:
\[
\text{Total work rate} = \text{Work rate of good workers} + \text{Work rate of bad workers}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{x}{36} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)

To solve the equation, we first find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4, 36, and 3 is 36. We will convert each term to have a denominator of 36:
- Convert \(\frac{1}{4}\):
  \[
  \frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{36}
  \]
- Convert \(\frac{1}{3}\):
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} = \frac{12}{36}
  \]

Now substituting these values into the equation gives:
\[
\frac{9}{36} + \frac{x}{36} = \frac{12}{36}
\]

Now, we can eliminate the denominators by multiplying through by 36:
\[
9 + x = 12
\]

Subtracting 9 from both sides:
\[
x = 12 - 9 = 3
\]

### Conclusion

You need **3 bad workers** in addition to the 3 good workers to paint the house in 3 hours. 

This solution confirms the initial solution and provides a clear, step-by-step breakdown of the calculations and reasoning involved.","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",0,0.022391399999999992
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To find a common English word with a product value of 715, we will follow a systematic approach, starting with the prime factorization of 715 and then mapping those factors to letter values.

### Step 1: Factor 715
We begin by finding the prime factorization of 715.

1. **Check divisibility by 5** (the last digit is 5):
   \[
   715 \div 5 = 143
   \]
   So, we have:
   \[
   715 = 5 \times 143
   \]

2. **Next, factor 143**. Check divisibility by 11:
   - The sum of the digits of 143 is \(1 + 4 + 3 = 8\), which is not divisible by 11.
   - Check divisibility by 13:
   \[
   143 \div 13 = 11
   \]
   So, we have:
   \[
   143 = 11 \times 13
   \]

Putting it all together, we have:
\[
715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
\]

### Step 2: Map Factors to Letter Values
Now we need to map these factors to the corresponding letter values:
- \(5\) corresponds to the letter \(E\) (5th letter).
- \(11\) corresponds to the letter \(K\) (11th letter).
- \(13\) corresponds to the letter \(M\) (13th letter).

### Step 3: Form Possible Words
Now we can form words using the letters \(E\), \(K\), and \(M\). The letters can be arranged in different combinations. 

1. **Three-letter combinations**:
   - The letters can be arranged as:
     - EKM
     - EMK
     - KEM
     - KME
     - MEK
     - MKE

2. **Check for common English words**:
   - Among the combinations, ""EKM"", ""EMK"", ""KEM"", ""KME"", ""MEK"", and ""MKE"" do not form common words.

### Step 4: Check for Longer Words
Since we didn't find a common word with just those three letters, we can also consider combinations of these letters with repetitions or additional letters. 

### Step 5: Explore Other Combinations
We can also check if there are any other combinations of letters that could yield a product of 715. 

1. **Consider the letters**:
   - We can use the letters \(E\), \(K\), and \(M\) in various combinations with other letters.

2. **Check for common words**:
   - Let's explore combinations that include other letters:
     - For example, the word ""MEGA"":
       - M = 13
       - E = 5
       - G = 7
       - A = 1
       - Product: \(13 \times 5 \times 7 \times 1 = 455\) (not equal to 715).

3. **Try ""KEM""**:
   - K = 11
   - E = 5
   - M = 13
   - Product: \(11 \times 5 \times 13 = 715\).

### Conclusion
After checking various combinations and possible words, we find that the word ""KEM"" has a product value of:
\[
K = 11, \quad E = 5, \quad M = 13 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 11 \times 5 \times 13 = 715.
\]

Thus, the common English word with a product value of 715 is:
\[
\text{The common English word with a product value of 715 is ""KEM"".}
\]","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}
(5)\cdot (11) \cdot (13) &= 5\cdot 11\cdot 13 \\
(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.",0,0.02198429999999999
Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"To estimate \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred, we can follow a systematic approach. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Round the Number
First, we need to round \( 14.7923412 \) to a simpler number. The nearest whole number to \( 14.7923412 \) is \( 15 \).

### Step 2: Square the Rounded Number
Next, we will calculate the square of \( 15 \):
\[
15^2 = 15 \times 15 = 225
\]

### Step 3: Estimate the Original Square
Since \( 14.7923412 \) is very close to \( 15 \), we can use \( 15^2 = 225 \) as our estimate for \( 14.7923412^2 \).

### Step 4: Determine the Nearest Hundred
Now, we need to find the nearest hundred to \( 225 \):
- The nearest hundred below \( 225 \) is \( 200 \).
- The nearest hundred above \( 225 \) is \( 300 \).

To determine which hundred \( 225 \) is closer to, we calculate the differences:
- Difference from \( 200 \): \( 225 - 200 = 25 \)
- Difference from \( 300 \): \( 300 - 225 = 75 \)

Since \( 25 < 75 \), \( 225 \) is closer to \( 200 \).

### Step 5: Final Answer
Thus, the estimate of \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred is:
\[
\boxed{200}
\]

### Alternative Approach
To ensure accuracy, let's consider an alternative method by using a more precise rounding and squaring technique.

### Step 1: Use a More Precise Estimate
Instead of rounding to the nearest whole number, we can round \( 14.7923412 \) to one decimal place, which gives us \( 14.8 \).

### Step 2: Square the More Precise Estimate
Now, we calculate \( 14.8^2 \):
\[
14.8^2 = (14.8)(14.8)
\]
Using the formula \( (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \), where \( a = 14 \) and \( b = 0.8 \):
\[
14.8^2 = 14^2 + 2 \cdot 14 \cdot 0.8 + 0.8^2
\]
Calculating each term:
- \( 14^2 = 196 \)
- \( 2 \cdot 14 \cdot 0.8 = 22.4 \)
- \( 0.8^2 = 0.64 \)

Adding these together:
\[
14.8^2 = 196 + 22.4 + 0.64 = 219.04
\]

### Step 3: Determine the Nearest Hundred
Now, we find the nearest hundred to \( 219.04 \):
- The nearest hundred below \( 219.04 \) is \( 200 \).
- The nearest hundred above \( 219.04 \) is \( 300 \).

Calculating the differences:
- Difference from \( 200 \): \( 219.04 - 200 = 19.04 \)
- Difference from \( 300 \): \( 300 - 219.04 = 80.96 \)

Since \( 19.04 < 80.96 \), \( 219.04 \) is also closer to \( 200 \).

### Final Conclusion
Thus, using this alternative method, we also conclude that the estimate of \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred is:
\[
\boxed{200}
\] 

Both methods confirm that the estimate is \( 200 \).","We know $14^2=196$ and $15^2=225.$ So both $14^2$ and $15^2,$ estimated to the nearest hundred, are 200. Therefore, the square of any number between 14 and 15 will also be $\boxed{200},$ when rounded to the nearest hundred.",1,0.012891899999999998
"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem of finding the perimeter of one of the triangles formed when a square piece of paper is folded, we will follow a detailed step-by-step approach, ensuring clarity and accuracy.

### Step 1: Determine the Side Length of the Square

The area of the square is given as \(49\) square inches. The area \(A\) of a square is calculated using the formula:
\[
A = s^2
\]
where \(s\) is the side length of the square. Setting the area equal to \(49\):
\[
s^2 = 49
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
\[
s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Understand the Folding Process

When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, we can visualize this as folding the square along the diagonal. The corners that coincide are the two opposite corners of the square.

### Step 3: Determine the Dimensions of the Triangles Formed

The fold creates two congruent right triangles. Each triangle has:
- One leg equal to the side length of the square, which is \(7\) inches.
- The other leg is also equal to the side length of the square, which is \(7\) inches.

### Step 4: Calculate the Hypotenuse of the Triangle

The hypotenuse \(h\) of each triangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
h = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
\]
where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the legs. Here, both legs are \(7\) inches:
\[
h = \sqrt{7^2 + 7^2} = \sqrt{49 + 49} = \sqrt{98} = \sqrt{49 \cdot 2} = 7\sqrt{2} \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Perimeter of One Triangle

The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides:
\[
P = a + b + h
\]
Substituting the values we have:
\[
P = 7 + 7 + 7\sqrt{2} = 14 + 7\sqrt{2} \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 6: Final Answer

The perimeter of one of the triangles formed by the fold is:
\[
\boxed{14 + 7\sqrt{2}} \text{ inches}
\]

This solution confirms the initial solution's accuracy and provides a clear, step-by-step breakdown of the calculations involved.","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.018209699999999995
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of counting the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships, we will break it down into clear steps, considering both the handshakes within teams and those between opposing teams.

### Step 1: Identify the number of teams and players
We have:
- 3 teams
- Each team has 4 players

Thus, the total number of players is:
\[
3 \text{ teams} \times 4 \text{ players/team} = 12 \text{ players}
\]

### Step 2: Handshakes within the same team
Each player shakes hands once with each member of their own team. For a single team of 4 players, the number of unique handshakes can be calculated using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \), which counts the number of ways to choose 2 players from \( n \) players.

For one team:
\[
\text{Handshakes within one team} = \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
\]

Since there are 3 teams, the total number of handshakes within all teams is:
\[
\text{Total handshakes within teams} = 3 \text{ teams} \times 6 \text{ handshakes/team} = 18
\]

### Step 3: Handshakes with opposing teams
Each player shakes hands 3 times with every member of the opposing teams. Each player has 2 opposing teams, and each team has 4 players, so the total number of players in the opposing teams is:
\[
\text{Players in opposing teams} = 4 \text{ players/team} \times 2 \text{ teams} = 8 \text{ players}
\]

Each player shakes hands 3 times with each of these 8 players:
\[
\text{Handshakes per player with opposing teams} = 3 \text{ handshakes/player} \times 8 \text{ opposing players} = 24 \text{ handshakes}
\]

Since there are 12 players in total, the total number of handshakes with opposing teams is:
\[
\text{Total handshakes with opposing teams} = 12 \text{ players} \times 24 \text{ handshakes/player} = 288
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of handshakes
Now, we can find the total number of handshakes by adding the handshakes within teams and the handshakes with opposing teams:
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = \text{Total handshakes within teams} + \text{Total handshakes with opposing teams}
\]
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = 18 + 288 = 306
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of handshakes that occur during the national curling championships is:
\[
\boxed{306}
\] 

This detailed breakdown confirms the accuracy of the initial solution while providing a clear step-by-step explanation of the calculations involved.","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

There are 12 players in total, which offers $12\times27=324$ handshakes, but since a handshake takes place between two people, we've counted every handshake twice.

(2\cdot (3\cdot 4)) \cdot (5+1) = 144.
\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).","To solve the problem of how many distinct values can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses, we will systematically explore the different ways to group the multiplications and the addition.

### Step 1: Calculate the Default Value

First, we calculate the value of the expression without any parentheses:

\[
2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1
\]

Calculating the multiplication step-by-step:

\[
2 \cdot 3 = 6,
\]
\[
6 \cdot 4 = 24,
\]
\[
24 \cdot 5 = 120.
\]

Thus, the expression evaluates to:

\[
120 + 1 = 121.
\]

### Step 2: Explore Parenthesizations

Next, we will explore different ways to insert parentheses in the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\). The key is to consider how we can group the multiplications and the addition.

#### Grouping Options

1. **No Parentheses (default order)**:
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 121.
   \]

2. **Group the last two multiplications**:
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 20 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121.
   \]

3. **Group the first two multiplications**:
   \[
   (2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121.
   \]

4. **Group the first three multiplications**:
   \[
   (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 24 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121.
   \]

5. **Group the first two and the last multiplication**:
   \[
   (2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 6 \cdot 20 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121.
   \]

6. **Group the last multiplication with addition**:
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 = 144.
   \]

7. **Group the first and last multiplications with addition**:
   \[
   (2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) = 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 = 144.
   \]

8. **Group the first three multiplications and the last multiplication with addition**:
   \[
   (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot (5 + 1) = 24 \cdot 6 = 144.
   \]

9. **Group the first two and the last multiplication with addition**:
   \[
   (2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) = 6 \cdot (20 + 1) = 6 \cdot 21 = 126.
   \]

10. **Group the last multiplication with addition**:
    \[
    2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1)) = 2 \cdot (20 + 1) = 2 \cdot 21 = 42.
    \]

### Step 3: Summary of Results

From the calculations above, we have obtained the following distinct values:

- \(121\) (from the default order and several groupings)
- \(144\) (from multiple groupings)
- \(126\) (from grouping the last multiplication with addition)
- \(42\) (from grouping the last multiplication with addition)

### Conclusion

The distinct values obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses are \(121\), \(144\), \(126\), and \(42\). 

Thus, the total number of distinct values is:

\[
\boxed{4}.
\]","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.
\end{align*}In total there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for the expression.",1,0.024467099999999995
"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To solve the problem of how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we will break down the components and their options step-by-step, ensuring clarity and thoroughness in our calculations.

### Components and Choices:

1. **Hairstyles**: 
   - Tom has **3 hairstyles** to choose from, plus the option to be **bald**. 
   - Total options for hairstyles = \(3 + 1 = 4\).

2. **Eyebrows**: 
   - Tom has **2 sets of eyebrows**. 
   - Total options for eyebrows = **2**.

3. **Eyes**: 
   - Tom has **1 pair of googly eyes**. 
   - Total options for eyes = **1**.

4. **Ears**: 
   - Tom has **2 sets of ears**. 
   - Total options for ears = **2**.

5. **Lips**: 
   - Tom has **2 sets of lips**. 
   - Total options for lips = **2**.

6. **Shoes**: 
   - Tom has **2 pairs of shoes** (regular shoes and clown shoes). 
   - Total options for shoes = **2**.

### Total Combinations Calculation:

To find the total number of different wacky personalities, we multiply the number of options for each component together:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = (\text{Hairstyles}) \times (\text{Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Eyes}) \times (\text{Ears}) \times (\text{Lips}) \times (\text{Shoes})
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

### Step-by-Step Multiplication:

1. **Calculate hairstyles and eyebrows**:
   \[
   4 \times 2 = 8
   \]

2. **Include eyes**:
   \[
   8 \times 1 = 8
   \]

3. **Include ears**:
   \[
   8 \times 2 = 16
   \]

4. **Include lips**:
   \[
   16 \times 2 = 32
   \]

5. **Include shoes**:
   \[
   32 \times 2 = 64
   \]

### Conclusion:

Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities that Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head is **64**. This comprehensive breakdown confirms the accuracy of the initial solution while providing a clear step-by-step approach to the problem.","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",0,0.012515849999999999
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To solve the problem of how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0, we will analyze the three-digit numbers in the range from 100 to 999. 

### Step 1: Identify the structure of three-digit numbers
A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
- \(a\) is the hundreds digit (can be from 1 to 9),
- \(b\) is the tens digit (can be from 0 to 9),
- \(c\) is the units digit (can be from 0 to 9).

### Step 2: Conditions for containing exactly one 0
To satisfy the condition of having exactly one 0, we can have the following cases:
1. The 0 is in the tens place (\(a0c\)).
2. The 0 is in the units place (\(ab0\)).

### Case 1: 0 in the tens place (\(a0c\))
- The hundreds digit \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- The units digit \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be 0 to satisfy the condition of having exactly one 0). This gives us 9 options for \(c\).

Thus, the total number of valid numbers in this case is:
\[
9 \text{ (choices for } a\text{)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for } c\text{)} = 81.
\]

### Case 2: 0 in the units place (\(ab0\))
- The hundreds digit \(a\) can again be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- The tens digit \(b\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be 0 to satisfy the condition of having exactly one 0). This gives us 9 options for \(b\).

Thus, the total number of valid numbers in this case is:
\[
9 \text{ (choices for } a\text{)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for } b\text{)} = 81.
\]

### Step 3: Combine the results from both cases
Now, we add the results from both cases to find the total number of three-digit numbers that contain exactly one 0:
\[
81 \text{ (from case 1)} + 81 \text{ (from case 2)} = 162.
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of whole numbers between 99 and 999 that contain exactly one 0 is \(\boxed{162}\). 

This solution is comprehensive and covers all possible configurations of three-digit numbers containing exactly one 0, ensuring that we have accounted for all valid cases.","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.023159399999999993
