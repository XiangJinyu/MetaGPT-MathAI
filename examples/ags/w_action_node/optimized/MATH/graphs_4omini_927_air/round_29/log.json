The base of each triangle is the full side length of the square, and the height of each triangle is half the side length of the square.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Base and Height of the Triangle\n- **Base** of the triangle: \\(b = s = 7\\) inches\n- **Height** of the triangle: \n\\[\nh = \\frac{s}{2} = \\frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Lengths of the Equal Sides of the Triangle\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we find the lengths of the two equal sides of the triangle. Each of these sides is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with:\n- One leg as half the base: \\(\\frac{b}{2} = \\frac{7}{2} = 3.5\\) inches\n- The other leg as the height: \\(h = 3.5\\) inches\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[\n\\text{side length} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2 + h^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(3.5\\right)^2 + \\left(3.5\\right)^2}\n\\]\nCalculating this:\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{(3.5)^2 + (3.5)^2} = \\sqrt{12.25 + 12.25} = \\sqrt{24.5} = \\sqrt{\\frac{49}{2}} = \\frac{7}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{7\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Perimeter of the Triangle\nThe perimeter \\(P\\) of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of all three sides:\n\\[\nP = b + 2 \\times \\text{side length} = 7 + 2 \\times \\frac{7\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nP = 7 + 7\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the perimeter of one of the triangles, expressed in simplest radical form, is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7 + 7\\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\n\nThe solution is confirmed to be accurate, with all calculations correct and consistent.
