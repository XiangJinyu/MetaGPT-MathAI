"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","Let's verify the refined solution step by step:

1. **Check if all the given information in the problem is used correctly**:
   - The problem states that there are two congruent acute angles and that the other three angles are equal to the sum of the two acute angles. The solution correctly defines \( x \) as the measure of each acute angle and \( 2x \) as the measure of each of the larger angles.

2. **Verify that each step in the solution logically follows from the previous one**:
   - The solution starts with defining the angles, then correctly applies the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon, and sets up the equation based on the angle definitions. Each step logically follows.

3. **Ensure that all calculations are accurate**:
   - The calculation for the sum of the interior angles is correct: \( 540 \) degrees.
   - The equation \( 2x + 3(2x) = 540 \) simplifies correctly to \( 8x = 540 \).
   - Solving for \( x \) gives \( x = 67.5 \) degrees, which is accurate.
   - The calculation for the larger angles \( 2x = 135 \) degrees is also correct.

4. **Confirm that the final answer addresses the specific question asked in the problem**:
   - The final answer states the common measure of the large angles, which is what the problem asks for.

5. **Verify that the final answer is formatted correctly using LaTeX notation enclosed in \(\boxed{}\)**:

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","Let's verify the refined solution step by step:

### Step 1: Check Given Information
- **Good Worker**: Can paint the house in 12 hours → Work rate = \( \frac{1}{12} \) houses/hour.
- **Bad Worker**: Can paint the house in 36 hours → Work rate = \( \frac{1}{36} \) houses/hour.
- **Time to paint the house**: 3 hours.
- **Number of good workers**: 3.

All given information is correctly used in the solution.

### Step 2: Verify Logical Steps
1. The work rate calculations for both good and bad workers are correct.
2. The total work done by the 3 good workers in 3 hours is calculated correctly:
   \[
   3 \times \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} \times 3 = \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses}
   \]
3. The remaining work calculation is correct:
   \[
   1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses}
   \]
4. The equation for the number of bad workers needed is set up correctly:
   \[
   x \times \frac{1}{36} \times 3 = \frac{1}{4}
   \]
   Simplifying leads to:
   \[
   x \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]
   which correctly leads to:
   \[
   x = 3
   \]

### Step 3: Verify Calculations
All calculations are accurate and consistent throughout the solution.

### Step 4: Confirm Final Answer
The final answer correctly addresses the question of how many bad workers are needed.

### Step 5: Format Final Answer
The final answer is formatted correctly in LaTeX notation.

Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.
