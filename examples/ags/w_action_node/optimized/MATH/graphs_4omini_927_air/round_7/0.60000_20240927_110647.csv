"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","Let's verify the refined solution step by step:

1. **Check if all the given information in the problem is used correctly**:
   - The problem states there are two congruent acute angles and that each of the other three angles equals the sum of the two acute angles. The solution correctly defines \( x \) as the measure of each acute angle and \( 2x \) as the measure of each of the other three angles.

2. **Verify that each step in the solution logically follows from the previous one**:
   - The solution starts with defining the angles, sets up the equation for the sum of the angles, and logically derives the equation \( 2x + 3(2x) = 540^\circ \). Each step follows logically.

3. **Ensure that all calculations are accurate**:
   - The calculation of the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is correct: \( 540^\circ \).
   - The equation \( 2x + 6x = 540^\circ \) simplifies correctly to \( 8x = 540^\circ \).
   - Dividing gives \( x = 67.5^\circ \), and calculating \( 2x \) gives \( 135^\circ \).

4. **Confirm that the final answer addresses the specific question asked in the problem**:
   - The final answer states the common measure of the large angles, which is indeed what the problem asks for.

5. **Verify that the final answer is formatted correctly using LaTeX notation enclosed in \(\boxed{}\)**:
   - The final answer is presented as \( \boxed{135} \), which is correctly formatted.

Since all steps are correct and consistent, the final answer is:

\[

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","Let's verify the refined solution step by step:

### Step 1: Check Given Information
- Good workers can paint the house in 12 hours.
- Bad workers can paint the house in 36 hours.
- The house needs to be painted in 3 hours.
- There are 3 good workers.

All the given information is correctly used in the solution.

### Step 2: Verify Logical Flow
1. The work rates for good and bad workers are defined correctly.
2. The total work done by the good workers over 3 hours is calculated logically.
3. The remaining work is derived correctly from the total work needed minus the work done by good workers.
4. The equation to find the number of bad workers is set up correctly.

### Step 3: Check Calculations
- **Work rate of good worker**: 
  \[
  \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
  \]
- **Work done by 3 good workers in 3 hours**:
  \[
  3 \times \frac{1}{12} \times 3 = \frac{3}{12} \times 3 = \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses}
  \]
- **Remaining work**:
  \[
  1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses}
  \]
- **Work done by \( x \) bad workers in 3 hours**:
  \[
  x \times \frac{1}{36} \times 3 = x \times \frac{3}{36} = x \times \frac{1}{12}
  \]
- Setting this equal to the remaining work:
  \[
  x \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
  \]
- Solving for \( x \):
  \[
  x = 12 \times \frac{1}{4} = 3
  \]

All calculations are accurate.

### Step 4: Confirm Final Answer
The final answer correctly addresses the question of how many bad workers are needed. 

### Step 5: Format Final Answer
The final answer is formatted correctly in LaTeX notation.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[

Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.
