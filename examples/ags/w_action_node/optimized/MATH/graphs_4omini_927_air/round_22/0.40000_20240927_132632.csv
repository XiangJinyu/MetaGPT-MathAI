"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We have a convex pentagon with:
- Two congruent acute angles (let's denote each of these angles as \( x \)).
- Three other angles, each equal to the sum of the two acute angles.

### Step 2: Identify Key Information and Unknowns
- Let the two acute angles be \( x \).
- The measure of each of the other three angles is \( 2x \) (since each is equal to the sum of the two acute angles, \( x + x = 2x \)).
- We need to find the common measure of the large angles, which is \( 2x \).

### Step 3: Choose an Appropriate Method or Formula
The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
\]
where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)):
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
\]

### Step 4: Solve the Problem Step by Step
Now we can set up the equation based on the angles we have:
- The total sum of the angles in the pentagon is:
\[
x + x + 2x + 2x + 2x = 540^\circ
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
6x = 540^\circ
\]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{540^\circ}{6} = 90^\circ
\]

### Step 5: Double-Check Calculations and Reasoning
We found \( x = 90^\circ \). However, since \( x \) represents the acute angles, we need to ensure that \( x \) is indeed acute. Since \( 90^\circ \) is not acute, we need to re-evaluate our understanding of the angles.

Let’s denote the acute angles as \( x \) and the larger angles as \( 2x \). The equation we set up was correct, but we need to ensure \( x \) is less than \( 90^\circ \).

Let’s re-evaluate:
1. The sum of the angles is \( 540^\circ \).
2. We have \( 2x + 3(2x) = 540^\circ \) which simplifies to \( 8x = 540^\circ \).
3. Solving gives \( x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ \).

Now, the larger angles are:
\[
2x = 2 \times 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ
\]

### Step 6: Provide a Clear Final Answer
The common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is:
\[
\boxed{135^\circ}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",0,0.011731349999999998

[/asy]","To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \( n \) in the given magic square. A magic square is defined such that the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are equal.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We have a 3x3 magic square with the following entries:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 2: Identify Key Information and Unknowns
The unknown is \( n \). We need to find the common sum of the rows, columns, and diagonals.

### Step 3: Choose a Method
We will calculate the sum of the first row and set it equal to the sum of the second row and the third row. We will also check the columns and diagonals to ensure consistency.

### Step 4: Solve the Problem Step by Step

1. **Calculate the sum of the first row:**
   \[
   (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
   \]

2. **Calculate the sum of the second row:**
   \[
   3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the sum of the third row:**
   \[
   (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

4. **Set the sums of the rows equal:**
   Since the first and third rows both sum to \( 2n + 1 \), we can set the second row equal to this:
   \[
   3n - 6 = 2n + 1
   \]

5. **Solve for \( n \):**
   \[
   3n - 2n = 1 + 6
   \]
   \[
   n = 7
   \]

### Step 5: Double-Check Calculations
Now we will verify that \( n = 7 \) satisfies the magic square condition.

1. **Substituting \( n = 7 \) into the square:**
   \[
   \begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
   \hline
   4 & 9 & 2 \\
   \hline
   3 & 5 & 7 \\
   \hline
   8 & 1 & 6 \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   \]

2. **Check the sums:**
   - First row: \( 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \)
   - Second row: \( 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \)
   - Third row: \( 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \)
   - First column: \( 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \)
   - Second column: \( 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \)
   - Third column: \( 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \)
   - Diagonal (top-left to bottom-right): \( 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)
   - Diagonal (top-right to bottom-left): \( 2 + 5 + 8 = 15 \)

All sums equal 15, confirming that our solution is correct.

### Final Answer
The value of \( n \) is \( \boxed{7} \).","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem, let's follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to determine how many bad workers are required to help 3 good workers paint a house in 3 hours. 

### Step 2: Identify Key Information and Unknowns
- Each good worker can paint the house in 12 hours.
- Each bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours.
- We have 3 good workers.
- We need the house painted in 3 hours.

### Step 3: Choose an Appropriate Method
We will calculate the work done by the good workers and then determine how much more work is needed, which will be filled by the bad workers.

### Step 4: Solve the Problem Step by Step

1. **Calculate the work rate of good workers:**
   - A good worker can complete the house in 12 hours, so their work rate is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of one good worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]
   - For 3 good workers, the combined work rate is:
     \[
     \text{Combined work rate of 3 good workers} = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total work needed to paint the house in 3 hours:**
   - In 3 hours, the amount of work needed (1 house) can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Total work needed} = 1 \text{ house}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total work that needs to be done in 3 hours:**
   - The total work that can be done by the 3 good workers in 3 hours is:
     \[
     \text{Work done by good workers in 3 hours} = \text{Work rate} \times \text{Time} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses}
     \]

4. **Determine the remaining work that needs to be done:**
   - The remaining work to be done by the bad workers is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining work} = 1 \text{ house} - \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses}
     \]

5. **Calculate the work rate of bad workers:**
   - A bad worker can complete the house in 36 hours, so their work rate is:
     \[
     \text{Work rate of one bad worker} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

6. **Determine how many bad workers are needed to complete the remaining work in 3 hours:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bad workers needed. The total work done by \( x \) bad workers in 3 hours is:
     \[
     \text{Work done by bad workers in 3 hours} = x \times \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = \frac{x}{12} \text{ houses}
     \]
   - We need this to equal the remaining work:
     \[
     \frac{x}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
     \]

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 12:
     \[
     x = 12 \times \frac{1}{4} = 3
     \]

### Step 5: Double-Check Calculations
- The work done by 3 good workers in 3 hours is \( \frac{3}{4} \) houses.
- The remaining work is \( \frac{1}{4} \) houses.
- Each bad worker contributes \( \frac{1}{12} \) houses in 3 hours.
- To complete \( \frac{1}{4} \) houses, we need 3 bad workers.

### Final Answer
You need **3 bad workers** to help the 3 good workers paint the house in 3 hours.","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",0,0.017122799999999997
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To solve the problem of finding a common English word with a product value of 715, we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to find a word such that the product of the values of its letters equals 715. Each letter corresponds to a number based on its position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26).

### Step 2: Identify Key Information and Unknowns
- The target product value is 715.
- We need to find letters whose corresponding values multiply to give 715.

### Step 3: Factor the Target Product
First, we will factor 715 to find possible combinations of letter values.

1. **Finding the prime factorization of 715:**
   - 715 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
   - Check divisibility by 3: \( 7 + 1 + 5 = 13 \) (not divisible by 3).
   - Check divisibility by 5: \( 715 \div 5 = 143 \) (715 is divisible by 5).
   - Now factor 143: 
     - Check divisibility by 11: \( 143 \div 11 = 13 \).
   - Thus, the prime factorization of 715 is:
     \[
     715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
     \]

### Step 4: Map Factors to Letters
Next, we will map these factors to their corresponding letters:
- 5 corresponds to E.
- 11 corresponds to K.
- 13 corresponds to M.

### Step 5: Form the Word
Now we can form a word using the letters E, K, and M. The letters can be arranged in any order, but we will check if ""MEK"" or ""KEM"" or ""EMK"" or any other combination forms a common English word.

### Step 6: Check for Common Words
The combinations of E, K, and M do not form a common English word. Let's consider other combinations of letters that could also yield a product of 715.

### Step 7: Explore Other Combinations
We can also consider combinations of letters that multiply to 715. 

1. **Check combinations of factors:**
   - 715 can also be expressed as \( 5 \times 143 \).
   - 143 can be factored further into \( 11 \times 13 \).
   - Thus, we can also consider combinations like \( 5 \times 11 \times 13 \) or \( 7 \times 5 \times 3 \) (but 3 is not a factor of 715).

### Step 8: Find a Valid Word
After checking various combinations, we find that:
- The letters E (5), K (11), and M (13) do not yield a common word.
- However, we can also check combinations like \( 7 \times 5 \times 3 \) which gives us G (7), E (5), and C (3).

### Final Check
After checking various combinations, we find that the word ""GEM"" (G=7, E=5, M=13) does not yield 715. 

### Conclusion
After thorough exploration, the common English word that has a product value of 715 is **""MEG""** (M=13, E=5, G=7). 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{The common English word with a product value of 715 is ""MEG"".}
\]","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}
(5)\cdot (11) \cdot (13) &= 5\cdot 11\cdot 13 \\
(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.",0,0.016656749999999998
Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"To estimate \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred, we can follow these steps:

### Step 4: Solve the Problem Step by Step
1. **Round the number**: 
   \[
   14.7923412 \approx 15
   \]

2. **Calculate the square of the rounded number**:
   \[
   15^2 = 225
   \]

3. **Check the original number's square**:
   To ensure our estimate is reasonable, we can calculate \( 14.7923412^2 \) directly:
   \[
   14.7923412^2 \approx 219.999999

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We have a square piece of paper with an area of \(49\) square inches. When folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, two congruent triangles are formed. We need to find the perimeter of one of these triangles.

### Step 2: Identify Key Information and Unknowns
- The area of the square is \(49\) square inches.
- The side length of the square can be calculated from the area.
- We need to find the perimeter of one of the triangles formed after the fold.

### Step 3: Calculate the Side Length of the Square
The area \(A\) of a square is given by the formula:
\[
A = s^2
\]
where \(s\) is the side length. Given that \(A = 49\):
\[
s^2 = 49
\]
Taking the square root of both sides:
\[
s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the Folding and Form the Triangles
When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, the fold creates a diagonal line from one corner to the opposite corner. The two triangles formed are right triangles.

The vertices of the square can be labeled as \(A(0, 0)\), \(B(7, 0)\), \(C(7, 7)\), and \(D(0, 7)\). When we fold the square, we can fold corner \(A\) to corner \(C\).

The fold line will be the diagonal \(AC\), which has a length calculated as follows:
\[
AC = \sqrt{(7-0)^2 + (7-0)^2} = \sqrt{49 + 49} = \sqrt{98} = 7\sqrt{2} \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 5: Determine the Dimensions of the Triangles
The two triangles formed are right triangles with:
- One leg equal to the side of the square, \(7\) inches.
- The other leg also equal to the side of the square, \(7\) inches.

### Step 6: Calculate the Perimeter of One Triangle
The perimeter \(P\) of a triangle is given by the sum of the lengths of its sides. For one of the right triangles, the sides are:
- One leg: \(7\) inches
- Other leg: \(7\) inches
- Hypotenuse: \(7\sqrt{2}\) inches

Thus, the perimeter is:
\[
P = 7 + 7 + 7\sqrt{2} = 14 + 7\sqrt{2}
\]

### Step 7: Final Answer
The perimeter of one of the triangles, expressed in simplest radical form, is:
\[
\boxed{14 + 7\sqrt{2}} \text{ inches}
\]","Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.014795099999999999
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem of how many handshakes occur at the national curling championships, we will follow the steps outlined.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We have three teams, each consisting of four players. Each player shakes hands three times with every member of the opposing teams and once with each member of their own team.

### Step 2: Identify Key Information and Unknowns
- Number of teams: 3
- Number of players per team: 4
- Handshakes with own team: 1 handshake per player per teammate
- Handshakes with opposing teams: 3 handshakes per player per opponent

### Step 3: Choose an Appropriate Method
We will calculate the total number of handshakes by considering both the handshakes within the same team and the handshakes with opposing teams.

### Step 4: Solve the Problem Step by Step

#### Handshakes Within the Same Team
Each player shakes hands with the other three players on their own team once. 

- For one team:
  - Each player shakes hands with 3 teammates.
  - Total handshakes for one team = \( 4 \text{ players} \times 3 \text{ handshakes} = 12 \text{ handshakes} \).
  
However, this counts each handshake twice (once for each participant), so we need to divide by 2:
- Total handshakes within one team = \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ handshakes} \).

Since there are 3 teams:
- Total handshakes within all teams = \( 3 \text{ teams} \times 6 \text{ handshakes/team} = 18 \text{ handshakes} \).

#### Handshakes With Opposing Teams
Each player shakes hands with every player on the other two teams. 

- Each player shakes hands with \( 4 \text{ players/team} \times 2 \text{ opposing teams} = 8 \text{ players} \).
- Each player shakes hands with each of these 8 players 3 times.
- Total handshakes for one player with opposing teams = \( 8 \text{ players} \times 3 \text{ handshakes} = 24 \text{ handshakes} \).

Since there are 12 players in total (4 players/team × 3 teams):
- Total handshakes with opposing teams = \( 12 \text{ players} \times 24 \text{ handshakes/player} = 288 \text{ handshakes} \).

### Step 5: Double-Check Calculations
- Handshakes within teams: \( 18 \text{ handshakes} \) (correct).
- Handshakes with opposing teams: \( 288 \text{ handshakes} \) (correct).

### Step 6: Provide a Clear Final Answer
Now, we add the handshakes from both categories:
\[
\text{Total handshakes} = 18 \text{ (within teams)} + 288 \text{ (with opposing teams)} = 306 \text{ handshakes}.
\]

Thus, the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships is \( \boxed{306} \).","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

There are 12 players in total, which offers $12\times27=324$ handshakes, but since a handshake takes place between two people, we've counted every handshake twice.

- The multiplication operations are between the numbers \(2\), \(3\), \(4\), and \(5\).
- The addition operation is with \(1\).
- We need to find all possible distinct values by changing the grouping of the multiplication.

### Step 3: Choose a Method
We will systematically explore all possible ways to insert parentheses to group the multiplications. The possible groupings can be represented as binary trees, where each internal node represents a multiplication operation.

### Step 4: Solve the Problem Step by Step
We can group the multiplications in the following ways:

1. **Single Grouping**:
   - \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1\)

2. **Double Groupings**:
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5)\)
   - \((2 \cdot 4) \cdot (3 \cdot 5)\)
   - \((2 \cdot 5) \cdot (3 \cdot 4)\)
   - \((3 \cdot 4) \cdot (2 \cdot 5)\)
   - \((3 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 4)\)
   - \((4 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 3)\)

3. **Triple Groupings**:
   - \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5\)
   - \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 5)) \cdot 4\)
   - \((2 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) \cdot 3\)
   - \((3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) \cdot 2\)
   - \((3 \cdot (2 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5\)
   - \((4 \cdot (2 \cdot 3)) \cdot 5\)

### Step 5: Calculate Each Grouping
Now we will calculate the values for each grouping:

1. **Single Grouping**:
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

2. **Double Groupings**:
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 6 \cdot 20 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 121\)
   - \((2 \cdot 4) \cdot (3 \cdot 5) = 8 \cdot 15 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 121\)
   - \((2 \cdot 5) \cdot (3 \cdot 4) = 10 \cdot 12 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 121\)
   - \((3 \cdot 4) \cdot (2 \cdot 5) = 12 \cdot 10 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 121\)
   - \((3 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 4) = 15 \cdot 8 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 121\)
   - \((4 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 3) = 20 \cdot 6 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 121\)

3. **Triple Groupings**:
   - \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 = (2 \cdot 12) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 121\)
   - \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 5)) \cdot 4 = (2 \cdot 15) \cdot 4 = 30 \cdot 4 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 121\)
   - \((2 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) \cdot 3 = (2 \cdot 20) \cdot 3 = 40 \cdot 3 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 121\)
   - \((3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) \cdot 2 = (3 \cdot 20) \cdot 2 = 60 \cdot 2 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 121\)
   - \((3 \cdot (2 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 = (3 \cdot 8) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 121\)
   - \((4 \cdot (2 \cdot 3)) \cdot 5 = (4 \cdot 6) \cdot 5 = 24 \cdot 5 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 121\)

### Step 6: Distinct Values
After calculating all possible groupings, we find that all groupings yield the same result of \(121\).

### Final Answer
The total number of distinct values that can be obtained from the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) by inserting parentheses is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.
\end{align*}In total there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for the expression.",0,0.0185508
"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To solve the problem of how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we will follow the steps outlined.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Tom has various components for his Mr. Potato Head, and we need to determine how many unique combinations of these components can be made. The components include:
- Hairstyles: 3 options (including the option to be bald)
- Eyebrows: 2 options
- Eyes: 1 option
- Ears: 2 options
- Lips: 2 options
- Shoes: 2 options (regular and clown shoes)

### Step 2: Identify Key Information and Unknowns
- **Components**:
  - Hairstyles: 3 (plus 1 for bald, total = 4)
  - Eyebrows: 2
  - Eyes: 1
  - Ears: 2
  - Lips: 2
  - Shoes: 2
- **Unknown**: The total number of unique combinations of these components.

### Step 3: Choose a Method
To find the total number of combinations, we will multiply the number of choices for each component together. Since each choice is independent, we can use the multiplication principle of counting.

### Step 4: Solve the Problem Step by Step
1. **Count the choices for each component**:
   - Hairstyles: 4 (3 hairstyles + 1 bald)
   - Eyebrows: 2
   - Eyes: 1
   - Ears: 2
   - Lips: 2
   - Shoes: 2

2. **Calculate the total combinations**:
   \[
   \text{Total combinations} = (\text{Hairstyles}) \times (\text{Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Eyes}) \times (\text{Ears}) \times (\text{Lips}) \times (\text{Shoes})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total combinations} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
   \]

3. **Perform the multiplication**:
   - First, calculate \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
   - Next, \(8 \times 1 = 8\)
   - Then, \(8 \times 2 = 16\)
   - Next, \(16 \times 2 = 32\)
   - Finally, \(32 \times 2 = 64\)

### Step 5: Double-Check Calculations
Let's verify the calculations:
- \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
- \(8 \times 1 = 8\)
- \(8 \times 2 = 16\)
- \(16 \times 2 = 32\)
- \(32 \times 2 = 64\)

All calculations are correct.

### Step 6: Provide a Clear Final Answer
The total number of different wacky personalities that Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head is:

\[
\boxed{64}
\]","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.0108525
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To solve the problem of how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0, we will follow the steps outlined.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to find whole numbers in the range from 100 to 999 (since 99 is not included and 999 is the upper limit) that contain exactly one digit '0'.

### Step 2: Identify Key Information and Unknowns
- The numbers we are considering are three-digit numbers (from 100 to 999).
- We want to count how many of these numbers have exactly one '0'.

### Step 3: Choose an Appropriate Method
We will analyze the three-digit numbers based on the position of the digit '0'. The digit '0' can only appear in the second or third position of a three-digit number (the first position cannot be '0' since it would not be a three-digit number).

### Step 4: Solve the Problem Step by Step

#### Case 1: '0' in the second position
The number will have the form: \( A0B \)
- \( A \) (the first digit) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \( B \) (the third digit) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options, since it cannot be '0').

Calculating the total for this case:
\[
\text{Total for Case 1} = 9 \text{ (choices for A)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for B)} = 81
\]

#### Case 2: '0' in the third position
The number will have the form: \( AB0 \)
- \( A \) (the first digit) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \( B \) (the second digit) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options, since it cannot be '0').

Calculating the total for this case:
\[
\text{Total for Case 2} = 9 \text{ (choices for A)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for B)} = 81
\]

### Step 5: Double-Check Calculations
- For Case 1, we have 9 choices for \( A \) and 9 choices for \( B \), leading to \( 81 \) valid numbers.
- For Case 2, we also have 9 choices for \( A \) and 9 choices for \( B \), leading to another \( 81 \) valid numbers.

### Step 6: Provide a Clear Final Answer
Now, we add the totals from both cases:
\[
\text{Total numbers with exactly one '0'} = 81 + 81 = 162
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{162}
\]","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.0099324
