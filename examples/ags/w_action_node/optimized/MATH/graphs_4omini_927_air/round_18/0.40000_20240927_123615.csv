"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We have a convex pentagon with two congruent acute angles and three other angles, each equal to the sum of the two acute angles. We need to find the measure of these larger angles.

### Step 2: Break Down the Problem
Let:
- \( x \) be the measure of each of the two congruent acute angles.
- The measure of each of the three larger angles will then be \( 2x \) (since each larger angle is equal to the sum of the two acute angles).

### Step 3: Identify Key Information
1. The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)):
   \[
   \text{Sum of interior angles} = (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
   \]

2. The angles in the pentagon can be expressed as:
   - Two angles of \( x \)
   - Three angles of \( 2x \)

### Step 4: Set Up the Equation
The total sum of the angles can be expressed as:
\[
2x + 3(2x) = 540^\circ
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 6x = 540^\circ
\]
\[
8x = 540^\circ
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
Now, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{540^\circ}{8} = 67.5^\circ
\]

### Step 6: Find the Measure of the Larger Angles
The measure of each of the larger angles is:
\[
2x = 2 \times 67.5^\circ = 135^\circ
\]

### Step 7: Final Answer
Thus, the common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is:
\[
\boxed{135^\circ}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",0,0.009400349999999997

[/asy]","To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \( n \) in the given magic square. A magic square is defined such that the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are equal.

### Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Magic Square

The magic square is structured as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 2n-9 & n \\
\hline
n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 2: Identify the Key Information

We need to find the value of \( n \) such that the sums of each row, column, and diagonal are equal.

### Step 3: Calculate the Sums

Let's denote the magic constant (the common sum) as \( S \).

#### Row Sums

1. **First Row:**
   \[
   (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
   \]

2. **Second Row:**
   \[
   3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
   \]

3. **Third Row:**
   \[
   (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

#### Column Sums

1. **First Column:**
   \[
   (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

2. **Second Column:**
   \[
   (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
   \]

3. **Third Column:**
   \[
   2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

#### Diagonal Sums

1. **Main Diagonal:**
   \[
   (n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = n - 3 + 2n - 9 + n - 1 = 4n - 13
   \]

2. **Other Diagonal:**
   \[
   2 + (2n-9) + (n+1) = 2 + 2n - 9 + n + 1 = 3n - 6
   \]

### Step 4: Set Up Equations

From the sums calculated, we can set up the following equations based on the requirement that all sums equal \( S \):

1. From the first row and third row:
   \[
   2n + 1 = 3n - 6
   \]

2. From the first column and second column:
   \[
   2n + 1 = 3n - 6
   \]

3. From the main diagonal and the second column:
   \[
   4n - 13 = 3n - 6
   \]

### Step 5: Solve the Equations

#### Solving \( 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \):
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \implies 1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n
\]

#### Solving \( 4n - 13 = 3n - 6 \):
\[
4n - 13 = 3n - 6 \implies 4n - 3n = -6 + 13 \implies n = 7
\]

### Step 6: Verify the Solution

Substituting \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
4 & 9 & 2 \\
\hline
3 & 5 & 7 \\
\hline
8 & 1 & 6 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Calculating the sums:

- Rows: \( 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \), \( 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \), \( 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \)
- Columns: \( 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \), \( 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \), \( 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \)
- Diagonals: \( 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \), \( 2 + 5 + 8 = 15 \)

All sums equal \( 15 \).

### Final Answer

The value of \( n \) is \( \boxed{7} \).","First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to determine how many bad workers are required to help 3 good workers paint a house in 3 hours.

### Step 2: Break Down the Problem
1. Calculate the work rate of good workers.
2. Calculate the work rate of bad workers.
3. Determine the total work needed to paint the house.
4. Set up an equation to find the number of bad workers needed.

### Step 3: Identify Key Information
- Each good worker can paint the house in 12 hours.
- Each bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours.
- We need the house painted in 3 hours.
- We have 3 good workers.

### Step 4: Apply Mathematical Concepts
1. **Work Rate of Good Workers**:
   - A good worker's rate is \( \frac{1 \text{ house}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ houses per hour} \).
   - For 3 good workers: 
     \[
     \text{Rate of 3 good workers} = 3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

2. **Work Rate of Bad Workers**:
   - A bad worker's rate is \( \frac{1 \text{ house}}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ houses per hour} \).
   - If we let \( b \) be the number of bad workers, then:
     \[
     \text{Rate of } b \text{ bad workers} = b \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{b}{36} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

3. **Total Work Needed**:
   - The total work needed to paint the house is 1 house.

4. **Total Rate Needed**:
   - To paint the house in 3 hours, the combined rate of good and bad workers must be:
     \[
     \text{Total Rate} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{3 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ houses per hour}
     \]

### Step 5: Set Up the Equation
Combining the rates of good and bad workers, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{b}{36} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

### Step 6: Solve the Equation
1. To eliminate the fractions, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4, 36, and 3 is 108.
2. Multiply the entire equation by 108:
   \[
   108 \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) + 108 \left(\frac{b}{36}\right) = 108 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   27 + 3b = 36
   \]

3. Solve for \( b \):
   \[
   3b = 36 - 27
   \]
   \[
   3b = 9
   \]
   \[
   b = 3
   \]

### Step 7: Final Answer
To have the house painted in 3 hours, you need **3 bad workers** in addition to the 3 good workers.","Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \boxed{3}$ bad workers.",0,0.013764149999999996
"Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26. The product value of a word is equal to the product of the values of its letters. For example, CAB has a product value of 3 $\times$ 1 $\times$ 2 = 6. What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","To find a common English word with a product value of 715, we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to find a word such that the product of the values of its letters equals 715. Each letter corresponds to its position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26).

### Step 2: Factor the Number
First, we will factor 715 to find possible combinations of letter values.

### Step 3: Factorization of 715
To factor 715, we can start by checking for divisibility by small prime numbers:

- **Divisibility by 5**: Since 715 ends in 5, it is divisible by 5.
  \[
  715 \div 5 = 143
  \]

- **Next, factor 143**: Check for divisibility by 11 (the next prime number).
  \[
  143 \div 11 = 13
  \]
  
Thus, we have:
\[
715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
\]

### Step 4: Corresponding Letter Values
Now we will convert these factors into their corresponding letter values:
- 5 corresponds to E
- 11 corresponds to K
- 13 corresponds to M

### Step 5: Forming the Word
The letters we have are E, K, and M. We can form the word ""MEK"" or ""KEM"", but these are not common English words. 

### Step 6: Check for Other Combinations
Since we are looking for common English words, we can also consider combinations of these letters or other factors of 715. 

We can also check if there are other combinations of letters that multiply to 715. 

### Step 7: Finding Other Words
We can also check combinations of letters that might yield the same product. 

After checking various combinations, we find:
- The word ""ME"" (5) and ""K"" (11) gives us \(5 \times 11 = 55\), which is not sufficient.
- The word ""M"" (13) and ""E"" (5) gives us \(13 \times 5 = 65\), which is also not sufficient.

### Step 8: Final Check
After checking various combinations, we find that the word ""SKIM"" has a product value of:
- S = 19
- K = 11
- I = 9
- M = 13

Calculating the product:
\[
19 \times 11 \times 9 \times 13 = 715
\]

### Final Answer
The common English word with a product value of 715 is **SKIM**.","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}
(5)\cdot (11) \cdot (13) &= 5\cdot 11\cdot 13 \\
(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.",0,0.011040899999999998
Estimate $14.7923412^2$ to the nearest hundred.,"To estimate \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Round the number
First, we round \( 14.7923412 \) to a simpler number for easier calculation. The nearest whole number to \( 14.7923412 \) is \( 15 \).

### Step 2: Calculate the square of the rounded number
Next, we calculate the square of \( 15 \):

\[
15^2 = 15 \times 15 = 225
\]

### Step 3: Estimate the original square
Now, we need to check how close \( 14.7923412^2 \) is to \( 15^2 \). We can calculate \( 14.7923412^2 \) directly for a more accurate estimate, but since we are estimating to the nearest hundred, we can consider the range of values.

### Final Answer
Thus, the estimate of \( 14.7923412^2 \) to the nearest hundred is:

\[
\boxed{200}
\]","We know $14^2=196$ and $15^2=225.$ So both $14^2$ and $15^2,$ estimated to the nearest hundred, are 200. Therefore, the square of any number between 14 and 15 will also be $\boxed{200},$ when rounded to the nearest hundred.",1,0.006898349999999999
"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given information and breaking it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We have a square piece of paper with an area of \(49\) square inches. When folded, one pair of opposite corners coincide, creating two congruent triangles upon unfolding.

2. **Finding the Side Length of the Square**: 
   The area of the square is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = s^2
   \]
   where \(s\) is the side length of the square. Given that the area is \(49\) square inches, we can find \(s\):
   \[
   s^2 = 49 \implies s = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Visualizing the Fold**: When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, the fold creates a diagonal line from one corner to the opposite corner. This diagonal divides the square into two congruent right triangles.

4. **Finding the Dimensions of the Triangles**: 
   The right triangles formed have legs equal to the side length of the square. Therefore, each triangle has:
   - Base = \(s = 7\) inches
   - Height = \(s = 7\) inches

5. **Calculating the Hypotenuse**: 
   The hypotenuse \(h\) of each triangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   h = \sqrt{(\text{base})^2 + (\text{height})^2} = \sqrt{7^2 + 7^2} = \sqrt{49 + 49} = \sqrt{98} = 7\sqrt{2} \text{ inches}
   \]

6. **Finding the Perimeter of One Triangle**: 
   The perimeter \(P\) of one of the triangles is the sum of the lengths of its three sides:
   \[
   P = \text{base} + \text{height} + \text{hypotenuse} = 7 + 7 + 7\sqrt{2}
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   P = 14 + 7\sqrt{2}
   \]

7. **Final Answer**: 
   The perimeter of one of the triangles, expressed in simplest radical form, is:
   \[
   \boxed{14 + 7\sqrt{2}} \text{ inches}

Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.",0,0.014568149999999997
"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","To solve the problem, we will break it down into manageable parts and calculate the total number of handshakes.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We have three teams, each consisting of four players. Each player shakes hands three times with every member of the opposing teams and once with each member of their own team.

### Step 2: Identify Key Information
- Number of teams: 3
- Number of players per team: 4
- Handshakes with own team: 1 handshake per player per teammate
- Handshakes with opposing teams: 3 handshakes per player per opponent

### Step 3: Calculate Handshakes Within Teams
Each player shakes hands with their own teammates. Since there are 4 players in a team, each player shakes hands with 3 teammates.

\[
\text{Handshakes within a team} = 4 \text{ players} \times 3 \text{ handshakes} = 12 \text{ handshakes}
\]

However, since each handshake is counted twice (once for each participant), we need to divide by 2 to avoid double counting:

\[
\text{Total handshakes within one team} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
\]

Since there are 3 teams, the total handshakes within all teams is:

\[
\text{Total handshakes within all teams} = 3 \text{ teams} \times 6 = 18
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Handshakes Between Teams
Each player shakes hands with every player on the opposing teams. There are 2 opposing teams, and each team has 4 players, so each player shakes hands with:

\[
\text{Opposing players} = 4 \text{ players/team} \times 2 \text{ teams} = 8 \text{ opposing players}
\]

Each player shakes hands 3 times with each of these 8 players:

\[
\text{Handshakes with opposing players} = 8 \text{ opposing players} \times 3 \text{ handshakes} = 24 \text{ handshakes}
\]

Since there are 12 players in total (4 players per team × 3 teams), the total handshakes between teams is:

\[
\text{Total handshakes between teams} = 12 \text{ players} \times 24 = 288
\]

### Step 5: Combine Both Totals
Now, we add the handshakes within teams and the handshakes between teams:

\[
\text{Total handshakes} = \text{Total handshakes within all teams} + \text{Total handshakes between teams}
\]

\[
\text{Total handshakes} = 18 + 288 = 306
\]

### Step 6: Final Answer
Thus, the total number of handshakes at the national curling championships is:

\[
\boxed{306}
\]","For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.

There are 12 players in total, which offers $12\times27=324$ handshakes, but since a handshake takes place between two people, we've counted every handshake twice.

The final answer is $\dfrac{324}{2}=\boxed{162}$ handshakes.",0,0.011405099999999998
"The expression $2\cdot 3 \cdot 4\cdot 5+1$ is equal to 121, since multiplication is carried out before addition. However, we can obtain values other than 121 for this expression if we are allowed to change it by inserting parentheses. For example, we can obtain 144 by writing \[
(2\cdot (3\cdot 4)) \cdot (5+1) = 144.
\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).","To solve the problem, we need to explore how inserting parentheses in the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) can yield different results. 

### Step 1: Understand the Expression
The original expression is:
\[
2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1
\]
Calculating the multiplication first:
\[
2 \cdot 3 = 6
\]
\[
6 \cdot 4 = 24
\]
\[
24 \cdot 5 = 120
\]
Thus, the expression evaluates to:
\[
120 + 1 = 121
\]

### Step 2: Inserting Parentheses
We can insert parentheses in various ways to change the order of operations. The multiplication can be grouped in different ways, and we can also change the order of addition. 

### Step 3: Possible Groupings
We can group the multiplication in the following ways:

1. \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5)\)
2. \((2 \cdot 4) \cdot (3 \cdot 5)\)
3. \((2 \cdot 5) \cdot (3 \cdot 4)\)
4. \((3 \cdot 4) \cdot (2 \cdot 5)\)
5. \((3 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 4)\)
6. \((4 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 3)\)

Additionally, we can also consider the addition of 1 in different positions:
- Adding 1 to the result of the multiplication.
- Adding 1 to one of the factors before multiplication.

### Step 4: Calculate Each Grouping
Let's calculate the results for each grouping:

1. **Grouping 1**: 
   \[
   (2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 6 \cdot 20 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

2. **Grouping 2**: 
   \[
   (2 \cdot 4) \cdot (3 \cdot 5) + 1 = 8 \cdot 15 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

3. **Grouping 3**: 
   \[
   (2 \cdot 5) \cdot (3 \cdot 4) + 1 = 10 \cdot 12 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

4. **Grouping 4**: 
   \[
   (3 \cdot 4) \cdot (2 \cdot 5) + 1 = 12 \cdot 10 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

5. **Grouping 5**: 
   \[
   (3 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 4) + 1 = 15 \cdot 8 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

6. **Grouping 6**: 
   \[
   (4 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 \cdot 3) + 1 = 20 \cdot 6 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

### Step 5: Adding 1 Before Multiplication
Now let's consider adding 1 to one of the factors before multiplication:

1. **Adding 1 to 2**:
   \[
   (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) \cdot (2 + 1) = 60 \cdot 3 = 180
   \]

2. **Adding 1 to 3**:
   \[
   (2 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) \cdot (3 + 1) = 40 \cdot 4 = 160
   \]

3. **Adding 1 to 4**:
   \[
   (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5) \cdot (4 + 1) = 30 \cdot 5 = 150
   \]

4. **Adding 1 to 5**:
   \[
   (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot (5 + 1) = 24 \cdot 6 = 144
   \]

### Step 6: Collecting Unique Results
Now we have the following unique results:
- 121 (from all original groupings)
- 180 (from adding 1 to 2)
- 160 (from adding 1 to 3)
- 150 (from adding 1 to 4)
- 144 (from adding 1 to 5)

### Final Count of Unique Values
The unique values obtained are:
- 121
- 180
- 160
- 150
- 144

Thus, the total number of unique values that can be obtained by inserting parentheses in the expression \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\) is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.
\end{align*}In total there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for the expression.",0,0.017247299999999997
"Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","To solve the problem of how many different wacky personalities Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head, we will break down the components and calculate the total combinations step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Components
The components of the Mr. Potato Head personality are:
- **Hairstyles**: 3 options (including the option to be bald)
- **Eyebrows**: 2 sets
- **Eyes**: 1 pair (googly eyes)
- **Ears**: 2 sets
- **Lips**: 2 sets
- **Shoes**: 2 pairs (regular shoes and clown shoes)

### Step 2: Determine the Options for Each Component
1. **Hairstyles**: 
   - 3 hairstyles + 1 option for being bald = 4 options
2. **Eyebrows**: 
   - 2 sets = 2 options
3. **Eyes**: 
   - 1 pair = 1 option
4. **Ears**: 
   - 2 sets = 2 options
5. **Lips**: 
   - 2 sets = 2 options
6. **Shoes**: 
   - 2 pairs = 2 options

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Combinations
To find the total number of different personalities, we multiply the number of options for each component together:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = (\text{Hairstyles}) \times (\text{Eyebrows}) \times (\text{Eyes}) \times (\text{Ears}) \times (\text{Lips}) \times (\text{Shoes})
\]

Substituting the values we identified:

\[
\text{Total Personalities} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

### Step 4: Perform the Calculation
Now, we will calculate the total step by step:

1. Calculate \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
2. Calculate \(8 \times 1 = 8\)
3. Calculate \(8 \times 2 = 16\)
4. Calculate \(16 \times 2 = 32\)
5. Calculate \(32 \times 2 = 64\)

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities that Tom can create with his Mr. Potato Head is:

\[
\boxed{64}
\]","There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{64}$.",1,0.009705449999999997
How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"To find how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0, we can break down the problem as follows:

### Step 1: Define the Range
The numbers we are considering are three-digit numbers, specifically from 100 to 999.

### Step 2: Identify the Structure of the Numbers
A three-digit number can be represented as \(abc\), where:
- \(a\) is the hundreds digit (can be from 1 to 9),
- \(b\) is the tens digit (can be from 0 to 9),
- \(c\) is the units digit (can be from 0 to 9).

### Step 3: Conditions for Exactly One 0
We need to find cases where exactly one of the digits \(a\), \(b\), or \(c\) is 0. 

#### Case 1: \(b = 0\)
- Here, the number takes the form \(a0c\).
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(c\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be 0, 9 options).
- Total for this case: \(9 \times 9 = 81\).

#### Case 2: \(c = 0\)
- Here, the number takes the form \(ab0\).
- \(a\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).
- \(b\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be 0, 9 options).
- Total for this case: \(9 \times 9 = 81\).

### Step 4: Combine the Cases
Now, we add the totals from both cases:
\[
81 \text{ (from Case 1)} + 81 \text{ (from Case 2)} = 162.
\]

### Step 5: Final Answer
Thus, the total number of whole numbers between 99 and 999 that contain exactly one 0 is:
\[
\boxed{162}.
\]","Numbers with exactly one zero have the form $\_ 0 \_$ or $\_ \_ 0$, where the blanks are not zeros.  There are $(9\cdot1\cdot9)+(9\cdot9\cdot1) = 81+81 = \boxed{162}$ such numbers.",1,0.008740349999999997
