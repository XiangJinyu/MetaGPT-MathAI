Calculate the work rate of good workers.\n2. Calculate the work rate of bad workers.\n3. Determine the total work needed to paint the house.\n4. Set up an equation to find the number of bad workers needed.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Key Information\n- Each good worker can paint the house in 12 hours.\n- Each bad worker can paint the house in 36 hours.\n- We need the house painted in 3 hours.\n- We have 3 good workers.\n\n### Step 4: Apply Mathematical Concepts\n1. **Calculate the work rate of good workers:**\n   - Work rate of one good worker = \\( \\frac{1 \\text{ house}}{12 \\text{ hours}} = \\frac{1}{12} \\text{ houses per hour} \\)\n   - Work rate of 3 good workers = \\( 3 \\times \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ houses per hour} \\)\n\n2. **Calculate the work rate of bad workers:**\n   - Work rate of one bad worker = \\( \\frac{1 \\text{ house}}{36 \\text{ hours}} = \\frac{1}{36} \\text{ houses per hour} \\)\n\n3. **Total work needed:**\n   - The total work needed to paint the house is 1 house.\n\n4. **Set up the equation:**\n   - Let \\( b \\) be the number of bad workers.\n   - The combined work rate of 3 good workers and \\( b \\) bad workers in 1 hour is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total work rate} = \\frac{1}{4} + b \\cdot \\frac{1}{36}\n     \\]\n   - We need this total work rate to complete 1 house in 3 hours, so:\n     \\[\n     3 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + b \\cdot \\frac{1}{36} \\right) = 1\n     \\]\n\n### Step 5: Solve the Equation\n1. Distributing the 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} + 3b \\cdot \\frac{1}{36} = 1\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{b}{12} = 1\n   \\]\n\n2. Subtract \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{b}{12} = 1 - \\frac{3}{4}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{b}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}\n   \\]\n\n3. Multiply both sides by 12:\n   \\[\n   b = 12 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = 3\n   \\]\n\n### Step 6: Double-Check Calculations\n- Work rate of 3 good workers: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) houses/hour.\n- Work rate of 3 bad workers: \\( 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{3}{36} = \\frac{1}{12} \\) houses/hour.\n- Total work rate: \\( \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{12} \\).\n- Finding a common denominator (12):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{12}, \\quad \\text{so} \\quad \\frac{3}{12} + \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ houses/hour}\n  \\]\n- In 3 hours, they can paint \\( 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = 1 \\) house, confirming the calculation is correct.\n\n### Final Answer\nTo have the house painted in 3 hours, you need to find **3 bad workers**.",
