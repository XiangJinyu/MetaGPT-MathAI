"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Review the problem statement**: We have a convex pentagon with two congruent acute angles, and the other three angles are equal to the sum of the two acute angles.

2. **Logical errors or misinterpretations**: 
   - Let the measure of each acute angle be \( x \). Therefore, the sum of the two acute angles is \( 2x \).
   - The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula \( (n-2) \times 180 \) where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, \( n = 5 \), so the sum is \( 3 \times 180 = 540 \) degrees.
   - The three larger angles, each equal to \( 2x \), would then be \( 3(2x) = 6x \).

3. **Verify that the solution addresses all parts of the question**: 
   - The total sum of the angles can be expressed as:
     \[
     2x + 6x = 540
     \]
     Simplifying gives:
     \[
     8x = 540 \implies x = \frac{540}{8} = 67.5
     \]
   - The measure of each large angle is \( 2x = 2 \times 67.5 = 135 \) degrees.

4. **Ensure that the answer is expressed in the required form**: The final answer is \( 135 \) degrees, which is correctly expressed.

5. **Check for any formatting issues in the LaTeX notation**: The LaTeX notation is correctly formatted.

Since all steps confirm the correctness of the solution, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{135}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.024908549999999998

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: The problem involves a magic square where the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal must be equal. We need to find the value of \( n \).

2. **Check for Logical Errors**: The entries in the magic square are:
   - First row: \( n-3, 3, n+1 \)
   - Second row: \( n+2, 2n-9, 1 \)
   - Third row: \( 2, n, n-1 \)

   We need to ensure that the sums of each row, column, and diagonal are equal.

3. **Verify the Solution**:
   - **Row Sums**:
     - First row: \( (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1 \)
     - Second row: \( (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6 \)
     - Third row: \( 2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1 \)

   Setting the first and second row sums equal:
   \[
   2n + 1 = 3n - 6
   \]
   Solving for \( n \):
   \[
   1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n
   \]

   Now, we check the third row:
   \[
   2n + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15
   \]
   The second row with \( n = 7 \):
   \[
   3n - 6 = 3(7) - 6 = 21 - 6 = 15
   \]
   The first row:
   \[
   2n + 1 = 15

   **Column Sums**:
   - First column: \( (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 2n + 1 \)
   - Second column: \( 3 + (2n-9) + n = 3n - 6 \)
   - Third column: \( (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = 2n + 1 \)

   Again, we find that the sums are consistent with \( n = 7 \).

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have good workers who can paint the house in 12 hours and bad workers who can do it in 36 hours. We need the house painted in 3 hours, and we have 3 good workers. We need to find out how many bad workers are required.

2. **Logical Errors or Misinterpretations**: 
   - The rate of work for good workers is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of the house per hour.
   - The rate of work for bad workers is \( \frac{1}{36} \) of the house per hour.
   - With 3 good workers, their combined rate is \( 3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the house per hour.

3. **Addressing All Parts of the Question**: 
   - We need to find the total work done in 3 hours. The total work required to paint the house is 1 house.
   - In 3 hours, the good workers will complete \( 3 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of the house.
   - Therefore, the remaining work is \( 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the house.

4. **Calculating the Number of Bad Workers**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bad workers. The combined rate of \( x \) bad workers is \( x \times \frac{1}{36} \) of the house per hour.
   - In 3 hours, the bad workers will complete \( 3 \times \frac{x}{36} = \frac{x}{12} \) of the house.
   - We need this to equal the remaining work: 
   \[
   \frac{x}{12} = \frac{1}{4}

   - Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3

What common English word has a product value of 715? It does not have to be of length 3.","Let's analyze the problem and the final solution step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We need to find a common English word whose letters' product values equal 715, where A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26.

2. **Logical Errors or Misinterpretations**: The final solution states that there is ""No common English word with a product value of 715."" We need to verify if this is indeed the case.

3. **Verification of Solution**: To find a word with a product value of 715, we can factor 715:
   \[
   715 = 5 \times 11 \times 13
   \]
   The values corresponding to letters are:
   - 5 = E
   - 11 = K
   - 13 = M

   Therefore, the product value can be achieved with the letters E, K, and M. The word ""EMK"" is not a common English word, but we can check for other combinations.

   Another factorization of 715 is:
   \[
   715 = 7 \times 5 \times 21
   \]
   The values corresponding to these letters are:
   - 7 = G
   - 5 = E
   - 21 = U

   The combination of these letters can form the word ""GEM,"" which is a common English word.

4. **Addressing All Parts of the Question**: The solution must identify a common English word, and ""GEM"" fits this criterion.

5. **Formatting Issues**: The final answer should be formatted correctly in LaTeX.

Given the analysis, the final answer should be:

\[
\boxed{\text{GEM}}
\]","Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have a square piece of paper with an area of \(49\) square inches. This means the side length of the square is \( \sqrt{49} = 7 \) inches. When the square is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, two congruent triangles are formed.

2. **Logical Errors or Misinterpretations**: The folding of the square creates two right triangles. The vertices of the square can be labeled as \(A(0, 0)\), \(B(7, 0)\), \(C(7, 7)\), and \(D(0, 7)\). When we fold the square such that corners \(A\) and \(C\) coincide, the fold line will be the diagonal \(AC\).

3. **Area and Triangle Dimensions**: The triangles formed will have legs equal to half the side length of the square. Each triangle will have legs of length \(7\) inches (the original side length of the square). The hypotenuse can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   \text{Hypotenuse} = \sqrt{(7)^2 + (7)^2} = \sqrt{49 + 49} = \sqrt{98} = 7\sqrt{2}.
   \]

4. **Perimeter Calculation**: The perimeter \(P\) of one triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides:
   \[
   P = 7 + 7 + 7\sqrt{2} = 14 + 7\sqrt{2}.
   \]

5. **Final Answer Formatting**: The answer must be expressed in simplest radical form. The perimeter of one triangle is \(14 + 7\sqrt{2}\).

Thus, the corrected final answer is:
\[

How many handshakes are there in total?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have three teams of four players each. Each player shakes hands three times with every member of the opposing teams and once with each member of their own team.

2. **Logical Errors or Misinterpretations**: 
   - Each team has 4 players, so there are a total of \(3 \times 4 = 12\) players.
   - Each player shakes hands with their own team members once. Since there are 4 players in a team, each player shakes hands with 3 others in their team, resulting in \(4 \times 3 / 2 = 6\) handshakes per team (since each handshake is counted twice).
   - Each player shakes hands with players from the other two teams. There are \(4 \times 2 = 8\) players from the opposing teams, and each player shakes hands with each of them 3 times, resulting in \(8 \times 3 = 24\) handshakes per player.

3. **Solution Addressing All Parts**:
   - Handshakes within the same team: \(3 \text{ handshakes per player} \times 4 \text{ players} = 12\) handshakes per team. Since there are 3 teams, this gives \(3 \times 6 = 18\) handshakes.
   - Handshakes with opposing teams: \(24 \text{ handshakes per player} \times 12 \text{ players} = 288\) handshakes.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - Total handshakes = Handshakes within teams + Handshakes with opposing teams = \(18 + 288 = 306\).

### Analysis of Parentheses Insertion

To find all distinct values, we can consider the different ways to insert parentheses:

1. **No Parentheses**: 
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121
   \]

2. **One Pair of Parentheses**:
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 2 \cdot 12 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 20 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)

3. **Two Pairs of Parentheses**:
   - \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5 + 1 = 24 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 6 \cdot 20 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)
   - \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) + 1 = 2 \cdot 60 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\)

4. **All Parentheses**:
   - \((2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 121\)

### Conclusion

After analyzing all possible ways to insert parentheses, we find that all configurations yield the same result of 121. Therefore, the total number of distinct values obtained from the expression is indeed 1.

### Final Answer

The final answer is correctly stated as:

\[
\boxed{1}

Thus, the original solution is confirmed to be correct.","By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}

Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Review the problem statement**: Tom has various components for Mr. Potato Head, and we need to calculate the total number of different combinations of these components, including the option to be bald (no hair).

2. **Identify components**:
   - Hairstyles: 3 options (including bald)
   - Eyebrows: 2 options
   - Eyes: 1 option
   - Ears: 2 options
   - Lips: 2 options
   - Shoes: 2 options (regular and clown)

3. **Logical interpretation**: Each component can be chosen independently, and the bald option means that for hairstyles, there are effectively 4 choices (3 hairstyles + 1 bald option).

4. **Calculate combinations**:
   - Total choices for hairstyles: \(3 + 1 = 4\)
   - Total choices for eyebrows: \(2\)
   - Total choices for eyes: \(1\)
   - Total choices for ears: \(2\)
   - Total choices for lips: \(2\)
   - Total choices for shoes: \(2\)

   The total number of combinations can be calculated by multiplying the number of choices for each component:

   \[
   \text{Total combinations} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
   \]

   Calculating this step-by-step:
   - \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
   - \(8 \times 1 = 8\)
   - \(8 \times 2 = 16\)
   - \(16 \times 2 = 32\)
   - \(32 \times 2 = 64\)

5. **Final verification**: The solution correctly accounts for all components and their combinations, confirming that the total number of different wacky personalities is indeed \(64\).
