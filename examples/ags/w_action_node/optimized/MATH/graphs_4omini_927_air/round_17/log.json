The task is to find different values by inserting parentheses.\n\n3. **Addressing All Parts of the Question**: We need to consider all possible ways to insert parentheses in the expression. The multiplication can be grouped in various ways, and we need to ensure that we account for all unique results.\n\n4. **Expression in Required Form**: The final answer is expressed in LaTeX notation, which is correct.\n\n5. **Formatting Issues in LaTeX Notation**: The LaTeX notation used in the final solution is correct.\n\nNow, let's enumerate the distinct values obtained by inserting parentheses:\n\n- \\( (2 \\cdot 3) \\cdot (4 \\cdot 5) + 1 = 6 \\cdot 20 + 1 = 121 \\)\n- \\( (2 \\cdot (3 \\cdot 4)) \\cdot 5 + 1 = (2 \\cdot 12) \\cdot 5 + 1 = 60 + 1 = 61 \\)\n- \\( 2 \\cdot (3 \\cdot (4 \\cdot 5)) + 1 = 2 \\cdot 60 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121 \\)\n- \\( 2 \\cdot ((3 \\cdot 4) \\cdot 5) + 1 = 2 \\cdot 60 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121 \\)\n- \\( (2 \\cdot 3) \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 + 1 = 6 \\cdot 20 + 1 = 121 \\)\n- \\( 2 \\cdot (3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5) + 1 = 2 \\cdot 60 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121 \\)\n\nAfter checking all combinations, the distinct values obtained are:\n- 121\n- 61\n\nThus, the total number of distinct values is 2, not 5.\n\n**Corrected Final Solution**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",
