"A particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have a convex pentagon with two congruent acute angles, and the other three angles are equal to the sum of the two acute angles.

2. **Logical Errors or Misinterpretations**: 
   - Let the measure of each acute angle be \( x \). Therefore, the sum of the two acute angles is \( 2x \).
   - The other three angles, which are equal to the sum of the two acute angles, will each measure \( 2x \).

3. **Sum of Interior Angles**: The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n - 2) \times 180 = (5 - 2) \times 180 = 540 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3(2x) = 540
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   2x + 6x = 540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x = \frac{540}{8} = 67.5
   \]

4. **Finding the Large Angles**: The measure of each of the large angles is:
   \[
   2x = 2 \times 67.5 = 135 \text{ degrees}
   \]

5. **Final Verification**: 
   - The two acute angles are \( 67.5 \) degrees each.
   - The three larger angles are \( 135 \) degrees each.
   - The total sum is:
   \[
   2(67.5) + 3(135) = 135 + 405 = 540 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   This confirms that the calculations are correct.

6. **Formatting Check**: The final answer is correctly formatted.

Since all parts of the solution are correct and the final answer is confirmed, the solution is valid.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]","If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \[
x+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \implies 8x = 540 \implies x=135/2.
\] The large angles each measure $2x=\boxed{135}$ degrees.",1,0.025181100000000005

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: The problem involves a magic square where the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal must be equal. We need to find the value of \( n \).

2. **Check for Logical Errors**: The entries in the magic square are:
   - First row: \( n-3, 3, n+1 \)
   - Second row: \( n+2, 2n-9, 1 \)
   - Third row: \( 2, n, n-1 \)

   We need to ensure that the sums of each row, column, and diagonal are equal.

3. **Verify the Solution**:
   - **Row Sums**:
     - First row: \( (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1 \)
     - Second row: \( (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6 \)
     - Third row: \( 2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1 \)

   Setting the first and second row sums equal:
   \[
   2n + 1 = 3n - 6
   \]
   Solving for \( n \):
   \[
   1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n
   \]

   Now, we check the third row:
   \[
   2n + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15
   \]
   The second row with \( n = 7 \):
   \[
   3n - 6 = 3(7) - 6 = 21 - 6 = 15
   \]
   The first row:
   \[
   2n + 1 = 15

   **Column Sums**:
   - First column: \( (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 2n + 1 \)
   - Second column: \( 3 + (2n-9) + n = 3n - 6 \)
   - Third column: \( (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = 2n + 1 \)

   Again, we find that the sums are consistent.

4. **Final Answer Format**: The final answer is \( n = 7 \), which is already in the required format.

5. **Formatting Issues**: The LaTeX notation is correct.

Since all checks confirm the correctness of the solution, the final answer is:

\[

"Each good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have good workers who can paint the house in 12 hours and bad workers who can do it in 36 hours. We need the house painted in 3 hours, and we have 3 good workers. We need to find out how many bad workers are required.

2. **Logical Errors or Misinterpretations**: 
   - The rate of work for good workers is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of the house per hour.
   - The rate of work for bad workers is \( \frac{1}{36} \) of the house per hour.
   - With 3 good workers, their combined rate is \( 3 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the house per hour.

3. **Addressing All Parts of the Question**: 
   - We need to find the total rate required to finish the house in 3 hours, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the house per hour.
   - The equation to solve is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} + x \cdot \frac{1}{36} = \frac{1}{3}
     \]
   - Here, \( x \) is the number of bad workers.

4. **Expression in Required Form**: 
   - We need to solve for \( x \) and express it in a clear format.

5. **Formatting Issues in LaTeX Notation**: 
   - The final answer should be checked for correctness and formatted properly.

Now, let's solve the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{4} + x \cdot \frac{1}{36} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

To eliminate the fractions, we can multiply through by 36:

\[
36 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + x = 36 \cdot \frac{1}{3}
\]

Calculating the left side:

\[
9 + x = 12
\]

Now, solving for \( x \):

\[
x = 12 - 9 = 3

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We need to find a common English word whose product value equals 715, where the product value is determined by the values assigned to each letter (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26).

2. **Logical Errors or Misinterpretations**: The final solution states that no valid common word was found. We need to verify if this conclusion is correct by checking the factorization of 715 and seeing if it corresponds to any letters.

3. **Factorization of 715**: 
   - The prime factorization of 715 is \(5 \times 11 \times 13\).
   - The corresponding letter values are:
     - 5 = E
     - 11 = K
     - 13 = M

4. **Forming Words**: We can form the word ""EKM"" from these letters. However, ""EKM"" is not a common English word. We should also consider combinations of these letters and their possible arrangements.

5. **Checking Other Combinations**: 
   - The product value can also be achieved by other combinations of letters. For example, we can check if there are any other combinations of letters that multiply to 715.
   - After checking various combinations, we find that ""ME"" (M=13, E=5) and ""K"" (K=11) can be combined in various ways, but they do not yield a common word.

6. **Final Verification**: After checking various combinations and possible arrangements, it appears that no common English word can be formed that has a product value of 715.

"A square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have a square piece of paper with an area of \(49\) square inches. This means the side length of the square is \(7\) inches (since \(7^2 = 49\)). When folded, two opposite corners coincide, forming two congruent triangles.

2. **Logical Errors or Misinterpretations**: The folding of the square creates two right triangles. Each triangle has legs that are half the side length of the square. The legs of each triangle will be \(7\) inches (the original side length) and \(7\) inches (the distance from the corner to the midpoint of the opposite side).

3. **Solution Addressing All Parts**: The area of the square is correctly identified, and the folding process is understood. The triangles formed are right triangles with legs of \(7\) inches.

4. **Perimeter Calculation**: The hypotenuse \(c\) of each triangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:

"At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We have three teams of four players each. Each player shakes hands three times with every member of the opposing teams and once with each member of their own team.

2. **Logical Errors or Misinterpretations**: 
   - Each team has 4 players, so there are a total of \(3 \times 4 = 12\) players.
   - Each player shakes hands with their own team members once. Since there are 4 players in a team, each player shakes hands with 3 others in their team, resulting in \(4 \times 3 / 2 = 6\) handshakes per team (since each handshake is counted twice).

3. **Opposing Teams Handshakes**: 
   - Each player shakes hands with every player on the two opposing teams. There are \(4 + 4 = 8\) players on the opposing teams. Each player shakes hands with each of these 8 players three times, resulting in \(8 \times 3 = 24\) handshakes per player.

4. **Total Handshakes Calculation**:
   - For each player, the total handshakes are \(6\) (with their own team) + \(24\) (with opposing teams) = \(30\) handshakes.
   - Since there are \(12\) players, the total number of handshakes is \(12 \times 30 = 360\).

5. **Final Count**: However, since each handshake is counted twice (once for each participant), we need to divide by 2:
   \[
   \text{Total handshakes} = \frac{360}{2} = 180.

1. **Review the Problem Statement**: The expression given is \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\). We need to determine how many distinct values can be obtained by inserting parentheses without rearranging the terms.

2. **Check for Logical Errors**: The expression evaluates to \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\) when calculated without parentheses. The task is to find different values by inserting parentheses.

3. **Verify the Solution Addresses All Parts**: The solution must consider all possible ways to insert parentheses. The possible groupings of the four numbers (2, 3, 4, 5) can be analyzed as follows:

   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1\)
   - \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 + 1\)
   - \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1\)
   - \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) + 1\)
   - \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1\)

   Each of these groupings will yield a different result.

4. **Ensure the Answer is in Required Form**: The final answer is presented as \( \boxed{6} \). We need to verify if this is indeed the correct count of distinct values.

5. **Check for Formatting Issues**: The LaTeX notation appears to be correct.

After analyzing the possible groupings, we find the following distinct values:

- \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1 = 121\)
- \((2 \cdot 3) \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 121\)
- \((2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)) \cdot 5 + 1 = 121\)

- \(2 \cdot (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5)) + 1 = 121\)
- \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5) + 1 = 121\)

All groupings yield the same result of 121. Therefore, the total number of distinct values obtained by inserting parentheses is actually **1**, not 6.

**Corrected Final Solution**:

Note: You cannot ""mix and match"".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.","Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Review the problem statement**: Tom has various components for Mr. Potato Head, and we need to calculate the total number of different combinations of these components, considering that he can choose to be bald (no hair).

2. **Identify the components**:
   - Hairstyles: 3 options (including bald)
   - Eyebrows: 2 sets
   - Eyes: 1 pair
   - Ears: 2 sets
   - Lips: 2 sets
   - Shoes: 2 options (regular and clown)

3. **Logical breakdown**:
   - For hairstyles, since he can be bald, we have 3 hairstyles (including bald).
   - For eyebrows, there are 2 options.
   - For eyes, there is 1 option (only one pair).
   - For ears, there are 2 options.
   - For lips, there are 2 options.
   - For shoes, there are 2 options.

4. **Calculate the total combinations**:
   The total number of combinations can be calculated by multiplying the number of choices for each component:
   \[
   \text{Total combinations} = (\text{hairstyles}) \times (\text{eyebrows}) \times (\text{eyes}) \times (\text{ears}) \times (\text{lips}) \times (\text{shoes})

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total combinations} = 3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2

5. **Perform the multiplication**:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6
   \]
   \[
   6 \times 1 = 6
   \]
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12

How many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?,"Let's analyze the problem of finding how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0.

1. **Problem Statement Review**: We need to find whole numbers in the range from 100 to 999 (since 99 is not included) that contain exactly one digit '0'.

2. **Logical Errors Check**: 
   - The numbers can be represented as three-digit numbers (from 100 to 999).
   - The digit '0' can only appear in the tens or units place, as having '0' in the hundreds place would not yield a three-digit number.

3. **Solution Addressing**:
   - **Case 1**: '0' in the tens place (format: \(a0b\)):
