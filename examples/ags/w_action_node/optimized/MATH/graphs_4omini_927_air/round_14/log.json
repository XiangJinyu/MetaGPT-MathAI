        "model_output": "To solve the problem of finding how many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one '0', we can break down the solution step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Range\nWe are interested in whole numbers between 100 and 999 (inclusive). This is because the problem specifies numbers between 99 and 999, and the smallest three-digit number is 100.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Structure of the Numbers\nA three-digit number can be represented as \\(abc\\), where:\n- \\(a\\) is the hundreds digit (can be from 1 to 9),\n- \\(b\\) is the tens digit (can be from 0 to 9),\n- \\(c\\) is the units digit (can be from 0 to 9).\n\n### Step 3: Conditions for Exactly One '0'\nFor a number to contain exactly one '0', we can have the following scenarios:\n1. The '0' is in the tens place: \\(a0c\\)\n2. The '0' is in the units place: \\(ab0\\)\n\n### Step 4: Count Valid Combinations\n#### Case 1: '0' in the Tens Place (Form: \\(a0c\\))\n- \\(a\\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).\n- \\(c\\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be '0' to satisfy the condition of having exactly one '0') (9 options).\n\nThus, the total for this case is:\n\\[\n9 \\times 9 = 81\n\\]\n\n#### Case 2: '0' in the Units Place (Form: \\(ab0\\))\n- \\(a\\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 options).\n- \\(b\\) can be any digit from 0 to 9, but it cannot be '0' (to satisfy the condition of having exactly one '0') (10 options).\n\nThus, the total for this case is:\n\\[\n9 \\times 10 = 90\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Combine the Counts\nNow, we add the counts from both cases:\n\\[\n81 + 90 = 171\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe total number of whole numbers between 100 and 999 that contain exactly one '0' is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{171}\n\\]",

The original expression evaluates to:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121.\n\\]\nHowever, by changing the order of operations through parentheses, we can obtain different results.\n\n### Step 2: Generating Parentheses Combinations\nWe can insert parentheses in various ways. The key is to consider all possible groupings of the four numbers (2, 3, 4, 5) and the operations (multiplication and addition). \n\n### Step 3: Evaluating Different Parenthesizations\nWe will evaluate the expression for different combinations of operations and parentheses. The operations we can use are multiplication (\\(*\\)) and addition (\\(+\\)). \n\nThe possible groupings of the numbers can be represented as:\n1. \\((a \\cdot b) \\cdot (c \\cdot d)\\)\n2. \\((a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)) \\cdot d\\)\n3. \\(a \\cdot (b \\cdot (c \\cdot d))\\)\n4. \\((a \\cdot b) + (c \\cdot d)\\)\n5. \\((a + b) \\cdot (c \\cdot d)\\)\n6.
